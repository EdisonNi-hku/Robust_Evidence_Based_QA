It might nab the occasional miscreant, but it does little to promote positive conduct or deter inappropriate use of corporate assets. Ultimately, the decision about whether, how much, and what types of monitoring to deploy will be a company-by-company choice, informed by the specifics of your business, the nature of your WFH policies, and the size of your organization and budget. We believe that a balanced approach including clear communications with employees about the existence of and reasons for a corporate monitoring program are consistent with a transparent culture and a relationship of trust.

Online263increased, 2020, p.8: Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) use antibodies to detect and quantitate the amount of antigen (analyte) in a sample. These assays are typically very sensitive and specific. It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites. When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.

In every 24-hour period, it is common for people to be continuously awake for about 16 hours and then almost continuously asleep for approximately 8 hours.

It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites. When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.

Online263increased, 2020, p.8: Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) use antibodies to detect and quantitate the amount of antigen (analyte) in a sample. These assays are typically very sensitive and specific. It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites. When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.

[/INST]  Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) are a type of analytical technique used to detect and quantitate the amount of a specific antigen (analyte) in a sample, and they typically rely on the use of antibodies to accomplish this task (Online263increased, 2020, p.8). These assays are known for their sensitivity and specificity, allowing for the detection of as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using high-affinity antibodies (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M) (Online263increased, 2020, p.8). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites (Online263increased, 2020, p.8)."
