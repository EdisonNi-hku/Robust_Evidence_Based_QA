Global surface temperatures have typically varied by 5°C to 7°C through these cycles, with large changes in ice volume and sea level, and temperature changes as great as 10°C to 15°C in some middle and high latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Since the end of the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, global surface temperatures have probably fluctuated by little more than 1°C. Some fluctuations have lasted several centuries, including the period 1400–1900 which ended in the 19th century and which appears to have been global in extent. The limited available evidence from proxy climate indicators suggests that the 20th century global mean temperature is at least as warm as any other century since at least 1400 AD. Data prior to 1400 are too sparse to allow the reliable estimation of global mean temperature. New analyses of proxy data

Natural variations in global temperatures are considered to be low, as compared to such human-induced warming. The latter is growing beyond a threshold that could not have been otherwise exceeded through natural variation (Herring et al. , 2016; IPCC,  2014).Human-induced warming reached ~1 °C (±0.2°C) above pre-industrial levels in 2017, with rises of 0.2°C (±0.1°C) per decade (IPCC, 2018) . Impacts include thermal stress, coral bleaching, and melting of sea and land ice (IPCC, 2013). The highest velocities in temperature change are found in flat landscapes and at higher latitudes (Loarie et al., 2009). Most land regions are warming faster than the average, most ocean regions slower (UNFCCC, 2015). Evidence of long-term geophysical and biological changes

Over the whole continent, there is medium confidence in an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes; it is likely that similar changes have also occurred in areas with poor data coverage, as warming is widespread and as projected future changes are similar over all regions (Section 11.3.5).In Asia (Table 11.7), there is very robust evidence  for a  very likely  increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes in recent decades. This is clear in global studies (e.g.,  Alexander, 2016; Dunn et al., 1549Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate Chapter 11112020), as well as in numerous regional studies (Table 11.7).

The warming in the subtropical gyres penetrates deeper into the ocean than other gyres (roughly 15ºN–45ºN and 15ºS–45ºS in Figure 5.3), following the wind-driven bowing down of the density surfaces (the solid lines in Figure 5.3) in these gyres (Terada and Minobe, 2018). The greater warming at 700–2000 m in the Atlantic than the Paciﬁc or Indian Oceans (Figure 5.3) reﬂects the strong southward transport of recently formed NADW at these depths by the AMOC.

Since transpiration accounts for much of the land-atmosphere water flux (Good et al., 2015), vegetation changes also play a significant role in overall changes in ET.With higher CO 2, the increase in evaporative demand can, to some extent, be counteracted by reduced stomatal conductance (‘physiological effect’), which reduces transpiration and increases leaf-level water use efficiency (WUE), but is highly species-specific.

At high values of cumulative emissions, some models simulate less warming per unit CO 2 emitted, suggesting that the saturation of CO 2 radiative forcing becomes more important than the effect of weakened carbon sinks (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015).

In addition, the net flux of atmospheric and continental freshwater is a key driver of sea surface salinity, which in turn influences the density and circulation of the ocean (Chapter 9). Understanding the interactions between the water and energy cycles is one of the four core projects of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). Latent heat fluxes, released by condensation of atmospheric water vapour and absorbed by evaporative processes, are critical to driving the circulation of the atmosphere on scales ranging from individual thunderstorm cells to the global circulation of the atmosphere (Stocker et al., 2013; Miralles et al., 2019). Water vapour

Water vapour is the most important gaseous absorber in the Earth’s atmosphere, playing a key role in the Earth’s radiative budget (Schneider et al., 2010). As atmospheric water vapour content increases with temperature, it has a  considerable influence on climate change (Section  7.4.2.2). Additionally, a  small fraction of the atmospheric water content is liquid or solid and has a  major effect on both solar and longwave radiative fluxes, from the Earth’s surface to the top of the atmosphere. The cloud response to anthropogenic radiative forcings, both in the tropics and in the extratropics (Zelinka et al., 2020), is therefore also crucial for understanding climate change (Section 7.4.2.4).The terrestrial water and carbon cycles are also strongly coupled (Cross-Chapter Box 5.1).

In particular, there has been a focus on the role of oceanic moisture transport and land-atmosphere feedbacks in explaining the observed trends in relative humidity.Water vapour is the most important natural greenhouse gas and its amount is expected to increase in a global warming context leading to further warming.

The second decomposition considers changes in the lapse rate assuming constant relative humidity (LR*) separately from changes in relative humidity (RH).The specific humidity (WV) feedback, also known as the water-vapour feedback, quantifies the change in radiative flux at the TOA due to changes in atmospheric water vapour concentration associated with a change in global mean surface air temperature.

It is not a one-dimensional mathematical measure, but rather a concept that encompasses various aspects of climate attribution, impact attribution, and the identification of weather sensitivity (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.18600).

In the absence of high adaptation (bars (A)), risk is expected to signiﬁcantly increase in urban atoll islands and the selected Arctic coastal communities even in a SROCC RCP2.6 scenario, and all geographies are expected to experience almost high to very high risks at the upper likely  range of SROCC RCP8.5. These results allow reﬁning AR5 conclusions by showing, ﬁrst, that high risk can indeed occur before the 1m rise benchmark (Oppenheimer et al., 2014; O’Neill et al., 2017) and, second, that risk as a function of SLR is highly variable from one geography to another.

These include resource-rich coastal cities, urban atoll islands, densely populated deltas, and Arctic communities (Chapter 4 Box 4; Figure 4.3 and Section 4.3.4). At the same time coastal protection is very effective and cost-efﬁcient for cities but not for less densely populated rural areas. Some geographies, such as urban atoll islands and Arctic communities face moderate to high risk even under RCP2.6 ( medium conﬁdence ).

Nineteenth-century investigators also established the existence of a natural biogeochemical carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes is removed from the atmosphere through a combination of silicate rock weathering, deep-sea sedimentation, oceanic absorption, and biological storage in plants, shellfish, and other organisms. On multi-million-year time scales, the compression of fossil organic matter is stored as carbon as coal, oil and natural gas (Chamberlin, 1897, 1898; Ekholm, 1901).Arrhenius (1896) calculated that a  doubling of atmospheric CO 2 would produce warming of 5°C–6°C, but in 1900 new measurements seemed to rule out CO 2 as a  greenhouse gas due to overlap with the absorption bands of water vapour (Ångström, 1900; Very and Abbe, 1901).

As coal consumption reached 900 Mt yr–1 only a  decade later, Arrhenius wrote that anthropogenic CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion might eventually warm the planet (Arrhenius, 1908). In 1938, analysing records from 147  stations around the globe, Callendar calculated atmospheric warming over land at 0.3°C–0.4°C from 1880–1935 and attributed about half of this warming to anthropogenic CO 2 (Figure 1.8; Callendar, 1938; Fleming, 2007; Hawkins and Jones, 2013).Studies of radiocarbon (14C) in the 1950s established that increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were due to fossil fuel combustion. Since all the 14C once contained in fossil fuels long ago decayed into non-radioactive 12C, the CO 2 produced by their combustion

However, all climate models exhibit biases of different degrees and types, and the practice of ‘tuning’ parameter values in models to make their outputs match variables such as historical warming trajectories has generated concern throughout their history (Section 1.5.3.2; Randall and Wielicki, 1997; Edwards, 2010; Hourdin et al., 2017). Overall, AR5 WGI assessed that climate models had improved since previous reports (IPCC, 2013b).Since climate models vary along many dimensions, such as grid type, resolution, and parameterizations, comparing their results requires special techniques. To address this problem, the climate 182Chapter 1 Framing, Context, and Methods1modelling community developed increasingly sophisticated model intercomparison projects (MIPs; Gates et al., 1999; Covey et al., 2003).

Furthermore, the ECS values in some of the new models are both above and below the 2°C to 5°C very likely  range, and although such models cannot be ruled out as implausible solely based on their ECS, some simulations display climate change that is inconsistent with the observed changes when tested with ancient climates.

This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels that are relatively close to present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Also shown to be important is the definition of global average temperature by which historical warming is estimated (Cross-Chapter Box  2.3; Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019b), as is the correct isolation of human-induced global warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability.

Recent literature assessed by Working Groups I and II of this AR6 underlines the urgency of climate action as cumulative CO2 emissions, along with other greenhouses gases (GHGs), drives the temperature change. Across AR6, global temperature changes are defined relative to the period 1850–1900, as in SR1.5 and collaboration with WGI enabled the use of AR6-calibrated emulators to assure consistency across the three Working Groups. The remaining ‘carbon budgets’ (see Annex I: Glossary) associated with 1.5°C and 2°C temperature targets equate to about one (for 1.5°C) to three (for 2°C) decades of current emissions, as from 2020, but with significant variation depending on multiple factors including other gases (Figure 2.7, and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3).

An important question is whether these changes can eventually be reversed, once levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are stabilized or reduced by humans and natural processes. Records from the past can help us answer this question.For at least the last 800,000 years, the Earth has followed cycles of gradual cooling followed by rapid warming caused by natural processes. During cooling phases, more and more ocean water is gradually deposited as snowfall, causing ice sheets to grow and sea level to slowly decrease. During warming phases, the ice sheets melt more quickly, resulting in more rapid rises in sea level (FAQ 9.1, Figure 1). Ice sheets build up very slowly because growth relies on the steady accumulation of falling snow that eventually compacts into ice. As the climate cools, areas that can accumulate snow expand, reflecting back more sunlight that otherwise would keep

Climate change is also recognized as a factor contributing to human conflict and disproportionate exposure to urban heat island intensity (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2022, p.9781; Hsu et al., 2021). The existence of climate change counter-movements and misinformation further hinder the accurate understanding and response to climate change (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.9929).

However, pathways that accelerate action and reduce annual GHG emissions to 47 GtCO2-eq by 2030 make it less challenging to limit warming to 2°C after 2030 (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_TechnicalSummary, 2020, p.178; IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.492).","To limit global warming to 2°C, the pace of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions would need to abruptly increase from 2030 onward to an average of 1.3–2.1 GtCO2-eq per year between 2030 and 2050, which is similar to the global CO2 emission reductions in 2020 that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.492).

Li et  al., 2013). Moreover, paleoclimate proxies, ESM simulations, and process understanding indicate that strong warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (with medium confidence ) and Southern Ocean (with high confidence ) will emerge on centennial time scales as the response to CO 2 forcing dominates temperature changes in these regions (Sections 7.4.4.1, 7.4.4.2 and 9.2.1). However, there is low confidence  that these features, which have been largely absent over the historical record, will emerge this century (Sections 7.4.4.1, 7.4.4.2 and Section 9.2.1).

More intense heatwaves of longer durations and occurring at a  higher frequency are projected over India (Murari et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2017) and Pakistan (Nasim et al., 2018). Future mid-latitude warm extremes, similar to those experienced during the 2010 event, are projected to become more extreme, with temperature extremes increasing potentially by 8.4°C (RCP8.5) over north-west Asia (van der Schrier et al., 2018). Over West and East Siberia, and Russian Far East, an increase in extreme heat durations is expected in all scenarios (Sillmann et al., 2013b; Kattsov et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017). In the MENA regions (Arabian Peninsula and Western Central Asia), extreme temperatures could increase by almost 7°C by 2100 under RCP8.5 (Lelieveld et al., 2016).

Temperature rise will be strongest in winter in most regions, while it will be the strongest on summer in the northern part of West Asia and some parts of South Asia where a desert climate prevails (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). The wet-bulb globe temperature, which is a measure of heat stress, is likely2 to approach critical health thresholds in West and South Asia under the RCP4.5 scenario, and in some other regions, such as East Asia, under the RCP8.5 scenario (high confidence) (Lee et al., 2021a; Seneviratne et al., 2021).

Paleoclimate reconstructions provide evidence of past Green Sahara states (DeMenocal and Tierney, 2012), under which rainfall rates increased by an order of magnitude (Tierney et al., 2017), leading to a vegetated landscape (Jolly et al., 1998) with large lake basins (Gasse, 2000; Drake and Bristow, 2006). The underlying driver of the Green Sahara is the periodic increase in summer insolation associated with the orbital precession cycle (Kutzbach, 1981). In this sense, Green Saharas are not direct analogues for a  response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), as these past states were forced by natural, seasonal changes in solar radiation. However, the climate dynamics of Green Sahara periods (which have global impacts, Pausata et al., 2020), and the speed of the transitions between Desert Saharas and Green Saharas, are relevant for future projections.

Although there are uncertainties in rainfall projections over the Sahel (Klutse et al., 2018; Gutiérrez et al., 2021), CMIP6 models project monsoon rainfall amounts to increase by approximately 2.9% per degree of warming (Jin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a), therefore, at higher levels of warming and towards the end of the century, a wetter monsoon is projected in the eastern Sahel (medium confidence).The frequency and intensity of extremely heavy precipitation are projected to increase under mid- and high-emission scenarios (Figures 9.13a; 9.14; Sylla et al., 2015b; Diallo et al., 2016; Akinsanola and Zhou, 2019; Giorgi et al., 2019; Dosio et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021).

The heat stress is expected to reduce the suitability of Arabica coffee in Mesoamerica, but it can improve in high-latitude areas in SA (SRCCL Chapter 4, Olsson et  al., 2019). There is limited evidence that these declines in crop yields may result in significant population displacement from the tropics to the sub-tropics (SR15 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018).There is a high confidence that heatwaves will increase in frequency, intensity and duration, becoming, under high emission scenarios, extremely long, over 60 d in duration in SA; the risk of wildfires will also increase significantly in SA (SRCCL Chapter 2, Jia et al., 2019). These processes are leading and will continue to lead to increased desertification that will cost between 8% and 14% of gross agricultural product in many CSA countries (SRCCL Chapter 3, Mirzabaev et al., 2019).

Sahel rainfall is also incorrectly located in prototype versions of a  few CMIP6 models, related to tropospheric temperature biases (Martin et  al., 2017). Amplified Saharan warming has increased the wind shear, leading to a tripling of extreme storms since 1982, which may partially explain the recovery (Taylor et al., 2017). Instead, observations, multiple models and SST-sensitivity experiments with AGCMs have suggested that stronger Mediterranean Sea evaporation enhances low-level moisture convergence to the Sahel, increasing rainfall (Park et  al., 2016). Meanwhile, an AGCM study suggested that GHGs alone (in the absence of SST warming) could cause Sahel rainfall recovery, with an additional role for anthropogenic aerosol (Dong and Sutton, 2015); recent changes in North Atlantic

In addition, greenhouse gas forcing has been invoked in explaining much of the increase in Sahel precipitation since the 1980s through enhanced meridional temperature gradient, with only a secondary role for aerosol (Dong and Sutton, 2015).Understanding of how ITCZ width and strength respond to a warming climate has improved since AR5 (Byrne and Schneider, 2016; Harrop and Hartmann, 2016; Popp and Silvers, 2017; Dixit et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020).

","Sea-level rise is primarily caused by the combined effect of sheet and glacier contributions, exceeding the impact of thermal expansion of ocean water (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2022, p.33). The dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 1970 is anthropogenic forcing (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2022, p.33). Additionally, the accelerated ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contributes to the acceleration of sea-level rise (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2022, p.33).

These people, including many Indigenous Peoples, depend on snow, glaciers and sea ice for their livelihoods, food and water security, travel and transport, and cultures (see FAQ 1.2). They are also exposed to hazards as the cryosphere changes, including ﬂood outbursts, landslides and coastal erosion. Changes in the polar and high mountain regions also have far-reaching consequences for people in other parts of the world (see FAQ 3.1).Warming of the climate system leads to sea level rise. Melt from glaciers and ice sheets is adding to the amount of water in the ocean, and the heat being absorbed by the ocean is causing it to expand and take up more space. Today’s sea level is already about 20 cm higher than in 1900. Sea level will continue to rise for centuries

","Climate change is indeed an existential problem for people in low-lying countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh. Studies have shown that these countries are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and loss of coastal ecosystems (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.9657; Adams et al., 2020, p.42). This vulnerability has led to various negative consequences, such as loss and damage from typhoon-induced floods and landslides (Acosta et al., 2016, p.33), climate-induced human displacement (Islam and Hasan, 2016, p.1051), and economic dependence on ecosystem services (Adams et al., 2020, p.42). Moreover, the impacts of climate change in these countries have been found to exacerbate social inequality (Islam and Winkel, 2017, p.32). Therefore, it is evident that climate change poses an existential threat to the people living in low-lying countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh.","Climate change poses significant challenges to low-lying countries like Bangladesh, with impacts such as floods, landslides, and cyclones causing loss and damage (Acosta et al., 2016, p.9657). The economic dependence on ecosystem services in these regions also makes them vulnerable to changes in the environment (Adams et al., 2020, p.9657). In particular, climate-induced displacement has been observed in the south-west coastal region of Bangladesh following Cyclone Aila (Islam and Hasan, 2016, p.9791). Furthermore, the adaptation to climate change in agriculture, a major sector in Bangladesh, is heavily reliant on formal institutions (Islam and Nursey-Bray, 2017, p.9791).

Important reductions in growth rates have been observed in developed countries, while the fastest increases are in the least developed countries (Figure 2.1.4) , and in Asia and the Pacific (Figure S3). These differences in growth rates are consistent with a ‘demographic transition’: population growth rates increase as child mortality decreases, leading to increased life expectancy; then fertility and growth decrease, leading to falling population growth rates, as has already been observed within some regions (Fogel, 1986; Hirschman, 1994; Thompson, 2003).

The effect of population ageing on emissions is contested in the literature. Ageing when accompanied by shrinking household size and more energy-intensive consumption and activity patterns results in increased emissions. However, an ageing labour force can also dampen economic growth and result in less energy-intensive activity such as driving, which decreases emissions (Liddle and Lung 2010; Liddle 2011). Ageing of the population characterises the demographic transition in both developed and developing countries. The implications of ageing for emissions depend on labour force participation of the elderly and differences in the consumption and investment patterns of different age groups (O’Neill et  al. 2012).

One in five adults still cannot read and write (Christiaensen et al., 2015). Assessment of status and trends is hampered by a lack of data, but the data which do exist show considerable variation across regions, countries and economy types, e.g., using the World Bank’s country profiling and metrics (Chuhan-Pole et al., 2013; HDRO, 2015; see Figure 1.15 ). Despite the data limitations, it is clear that tackling inequalities remains a considerable challenge for the future (World Bank,  2015a).As indicated earlier, Africa is still largely agrarian and people living in rural areas experience most of the continent’s poverty, both in terms of income and also through measures like the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) (Christiaensen

By 2010, albeit with important differences between countries, it had become the second fastest growing economy and a prime destination for Foreign Direct Investments and other financial flows. The latter include remittances that now surpass foreign aid to the region (Bodomo, 2013). Such growth has been widespread across sectors, including in services, natural resources, and agriculture (Roxburgh et al., 2010). At the same time, Africa was considered the only region that emerged from the Millennium Development Goals with increasing extreme poverty (Asongu, 2015; World Bank, 2016). In 2010, half of its population was living under the extreme poverty line of $1.25 per day (UN, 2013). The related conclusions are, however, contested by certain recent studies.

Also, key to consider are how the impacts of global change, including climate change and biodiversity loss, exacerbate existing gender inequalities, jeopardizing future well-being opportunities with important implications for all SDGs and the intent to leave no one behind (Aguilar et al., 2015; Arora-Jonsson, 2011; Nightingale, 2006). A decrease in nature and NCP have gender differentiated impacts with women and girls most often being negatively impacted by these changes (UNEP , 2016d). The gender-differentiated consequences of climate change increases the burden on women to: seek alternative sources of food and income mainly from the utilization of nature and NCP (Bechtel, 2010; Momsen 2007), provide (unpaid) healthcare linked to disaster-related health risks and food and water insecurity (Babugura et al., 2010) and secure access to climate-smart agriculture programmes (UNEP , 2016d),

This is because gender relations mediate experiences with climate change, whether in relation to water (Köhler et al., 2019) (see also Sections 4.7, 4.3.3, 4.6.4, 5.3), forests (Arora-Jonsson, 2019), agriculture (Carr and Thompson, 2014; Balehey et al., 2018; Garcia et al., 2020) (see also Chapter 4, Section 5.4), marine systems (Mcleod et al., 2018; Garcia et al., 2020) (see also Section 5.9) or urban environments (Reckien et al., 2018; Susan Solomon et al., 2021) (see also Chapter 6). Climate change has direct negative impacts on women’s livelihoods due to their unequal control over and access to resources (e.g., land, credit) and because they are often the ones

Even when national policies attempt to be more gendered, there is criticism that they use gender-neutral language or include gender analysis without proposing how to alter differential vulnerability (Mersha and van Laerhoven, 2019; Singh et al., 2021b). More importantly, the mere inclusion of women and men in planning does not necessarily translate to substantial gender-transformative action, for example in National Adaptation Programmes of Action across sub-Saharan Africa (Holvoet and Inberg, 2014; Nyasimi et al., 2018) and national and sub-national climate action plans in India (Singh et al., 2021b).

Climate change impacts can also heighten existing gender inequalities (Jost et  al., 2016; Glazebrook et al., 2020). On the one hand, climate change impacts can be gendered as a result of customary roles in society, such as triple workloads for women (i.e., economic labour, household and family labour, and duties of community participation), and occupational hazards from gendered work indoors and outdoors (Murray et al., 2016).

Therefore, addressing energy and fossil fuels is essential in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change.","Energy and fossil fuels are central to discussions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change due to their significant contribution to global warming (Tubiello et al., 2015, p.1903). The extraction, storage, transformation, and use of these energy sources have considerable negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, contributing to climate degradation and climate change (IPBES GLOBAL REPORT, 2018, p.6390). Furthermore, the emissions from existing energy infrastructure pose a threat to achieving the 1.5°C climate target (Tong et al., 2019, p.1903). The potential emissions of CO2 and methane from proved reserves of fossil fuels present an alternative analysis of the climate impact of these energy sources (Heede and Oreskes, 2016, p.1798). Lastly, fossil fuel subsidies introduce economic inefficiency within systems and their removal could lead to reductions in CO2 emissions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.4491)."

This is the case of oil consumption by combustion engine cars which could be substituted with electric cars (Aghion et al. 2016). If there is no close substitute for a ‘dirty resource’, then its intensity in production could still be reduced by increasing the efficiency of the dirty resource relative to the efficiency of other inputs (Hassler et al. 2012; André and Smulders 2014; Witajewski-Baltvilks et al. 2017).

Coal mine methane emissions are also estimated to be substantially higher than previously assessed (Kholod et al. 2020). Alvarez et al.

Moreover, coal power expansion has slowed down in Asia, as countries have suspended and cancelled new projects for reasons such as overcapacity, environmental constraints, and the development of renewables (Box 6.2).Different regions have replaced retired coal with different energy sources. Old coal fleets have been replaced approximately half by gas and half by renewables in the USA, mainly by renewables in the EU, and by advanced coal plants and renewables in Asia (EMBER 2020). Replacing old coal with new coal facilities is inconsistent with limiting warming to 2°C or below (high confidence) (Pfeiffer et al. 2016, 2018; Smith et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2019) (Section 6.7.4).

Similarly, for ongoing underground mining projects, coal mine methane recovery can be economic for major coal producers such as China and India. Coal mine methane and ventilation air methane recovery can reduce the fugitive methane emissions by 50–75% (Zhou et al. 2016; Singh and Sahu 2018).The cost of producing electricity from fossil sources has remained roughly the same with some regional exceptions while the costs of producing transport fuels has gone down significantly (high confidence). The cost of producing electricity from fossil fuels has remained largely static, with the exception of some regional changes, for example, a 40% cost reduction in the USA for natural gas (Rai et al. 2019), where the gas wellhead price has declined by almost two-thirds [END OF SOURCES]

They can be used by existing long-lived energy and feedstock infrastructure, transport and storage, which can compensate for seasonal supply fluctuations and contribute to enhancing energy security (Ampelli et al. 2015). Finally, they can reduce the GHG intensity of end uses that are very difficult to run on electricity, hydrogen or ammonia (e.g.,  long-haul aviation). However, their equivalent mitigation cost today would be very high (USD960–1440 tCO 2-eq–1), with the potential to fall to USD24–324 tCO 2-eq–1) with commercial economies of scale, with very high uncertainty (Hepburn et al. 2019; IEA 2020a; Ueckerdt et al. 2021).A very large and important uncertainty is the long-term demand for hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels (whether fossil-, biomass- or DAC-based), chemical feedstocks (e.g.,  methanol and ethylene) and materials, and competition for biomass feedstock with other
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.10046: policy costs (medium evidence, high agreement) (Liu et al. 2020).The impact on the value of established resources will be mitigated, to some extent, by the reduced incentive to explore for and develop new fossil fuel supplies. Nevertheless, efforts to lower global emissions will mean substantially less demand for fossil fuels, with the majority of current coal reserves and large shares of known gas and oil reserves needing to remain unused, with great diversity in impacts between different countries (McGlade and Ekins 2015) (Chapters 3, 6, 15). Estimates of the potential future loss in value differ greatly. There is uncertainty about remaining future fossil fuel use under different mitigation scenarios, as well as future fossil fuel prices depending on extraction costs, market structures and policies. Estimates of total cumulative fossil fuel revenue lost range between 5–67 trillion USD (Bauer et al. 2015) with an estimate of the net present value of lost

Fossil fuel use may persist, for example, if and where the costs of such fuels and the compensating carbon management (e.g.,  CDR, CCS) are less than non-fossil energy. For most applications, however, it is likely that electrification (McCollum et al. 2014; Madeddu et al. 2020; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) or use of non-fossil alternative fuels (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011; Hänggi et al. 2019; Ueckerdt et al. 2021) will prove to be the cheapest options. Most residual demand for fossil fuels is likely to predominantly be petroleum and natural gas given their high energy density (Davis et al. 2018), while demand for coal in net-zero energy systems is likely to be very low (Luderer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020, Section 6.7.4) (high confidence).There is considerable flexibility regarding the overall quantity of

Combining fossil fuels with CCS can increase their acceptability (Van Rijnsoever et al. 2015; Bessette and Arvai 2018). Some people seem ambivalent about natural gas, as they perceive both benefits (e.g., affordability, less carbon emissions than coal) and disadvantages (e.g., finite resource, contributing to climate change) (Blumer et al. 2018).Fossil fuel subsidies have been valued in the order of USD0.5–5 trillion annually by various estimates which have the tendency to introduce economic inefficiency within systems (Jakob et al. 2015; Merrill et al. 2015) (high confidence).

This chapter provides a structured assessment of this new literature and establishes the most important thematic links to other chapters in this report.4 Greenhouse gases are gaseous constituents of the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H 2O), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2O), methane (CH 4), and ozone (O 3) are the primary GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere.

07_SROCC_Ch05_FINAL, 2021, p.561: Due to these uncertainties, there is currently low conﬁdence  that control of sediment disturbance can be used for climate mitigation.There is theoretically greater potential for carbon removal by ‘enhanced weathering’ using mineral additions to coastal waters (and the open ocean) (Rau, 2011; Renforth and Henderson, 2017). These approaches are based on increasing the naturally-occurring uptake of CO2 by carbonates (e.g., calcite and dolomite) or silicate minerals (such as olivine). Such rock-weathering currently sequesters ~0.25 GtC yr–1, on land and at sea (Taylor et al. 2015) and provides the longterm control of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. It could be enhanced by adding ground minerals to beaches (Montserrat et al. 2017) or the sea surface. Other geochemical approaches for adding alkalinity that are less directly based on natural processes (Rau et al. 2012; GESAMP , 2019) are not considered here.Enhanced weathering methods might be used to reduce local

Silicate rocks such as basalt, containing minerals rich in calcium and magnesium and lacking metal ions such as nickel and chromium, are most suitable for enhanced weathering (Beerling et al. 2018); they reduce soil solution acidity during dissolution, and promote the chemical transformation of CO 2 to bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions can precipitate in soils and drainage waters as a  solid carbonate mineral (Manning 2008), or remain dissolved and increase alkalinity levels in the ocean when the water reaches the sea (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The modelling study by Cipolla et al. (2021) found that rate of weathering is greater in high rainfall environments, and was increased by organic matter amendment.Status: Enhanced weathering has been demonstrated in the laboratory and in small-scale field trials (TRL 3–4) but has yet to be demonstrated at scale (Beerling et al. 2018; Amann et al. 2020). 12681268

As noted above, any significant expansion of the mining industry would require careful assessment to avoid possible detrimental effects on biodiversity (Amundson et al. 2015). The processing of an additional 10 billion tonnes of rock would require up to 3000 Terawatt-hours of energy, which could represent approximately 0.1–6 % of global electricity use in 2100. The emissions associated with this additional energy generation may reduce the net carbon dioxide removal by up to 30% with present-day grid average emissions, but this efficiency loss would decrease with low-carbon power (Beerling et al. 2020).Role in mitigation pathways: Only one study to date has included enhanced weathering in an integrated assessment model to explore mitigation pathways (Strefler et al. 2021).Status, costs, potentials, risk and impacts, co-benefits, trade-offs and
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.9069: the potential of carbon removal by enhanced weathering (including adding carbonate and olivine to both oceans and soils) was estimated to be 3.7  GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2100, but with mean annual removal an order of magnitude less at 0.2 GtC-eq yr–1 (Lenton 2014). The estimates reported in Smith et al. (2016) are based on the potential estimates of Lenton (2014). Beerling et al. (2020) estimate that up to 2 GtCO 2 yr–1 could be removed by 2050 by spreading basalt onto 35–59% (weighted mean 53%) of agricultural land of 12 countries. Fuss et al. (2018) provide an author judgement range for potential of 2–4 GtCO 2 yr−1 for 2050.Risks and impacts: Mining of rocks for enhanced weathering will have local impacts and carries risks similar to those associated with the mining of mineral construction aggregates, with the possible additional risk of greater dust generation from fine comminution and land application.

","Anthropogenic carbon dioxide is not small in the scheme of planetary reservoirs. The IPCC AR6 report states that there have been improvements in estimating anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks, including emissions from cement production, land use changes, and ocean observation-based sink estimates (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2018, p.4827). Additionally, the report highlights the decreasing capacity of the ocean to take up additional anthropogenic CO2, indicating the significant impact of human activities on carbon storage (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2022, p.5137). Therefore, the sources suggest that anthropogenic carbon dioxide is a significant component of planetary reservoirs.","Anthropogenic carbon dioxide, while seemingly small in comparison to the vast planetary reservoirs, has significant impacts on the global carbon mass balance. Since the beginning of the industrial era, human activities have perturbed the balance between carbon reservoirs, with improvements in carbon budget estimates showing the influence of factors such as emissions from cement production and forestry, and the sink associated with cement carbonation (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2018, p.4827). The ocean's capacity to absorb and store additional anthropogenic CO2 is decreasing under climate change, reflecting a reduced buffering capacity (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2022, p.5137). Changes in anthropogenic carbon storage have also been observed in specific regions such as the Northeast Pacific over the last decade (Chu et al., 2016, p.5390). Therefore, despite the magnitude of natural carbon reservoirs, the influence of anthropogenic CO2 is substantial and disruptive."

IPBES_ASSESSMENT_SUWS_FULL_REPORT, 2020, p.3504: volcanic eruptions can be catastrophic, spewing lava and ashes, posing a severe risk to people and their livelihoods. Thus, volcanic activities can be considered natural sources of pollution. Ashes ejected from volcanoes can cause much nuisance to farmers, burying agricultural lands and destroying crops. The ashes can also negatively impact human health and animals, contaminating infrastructures and disrupting aviation and land transport (Small & Naumann, 2001).The numerous active volcanic mountains in Africa are exemplified by the frequent rage of the Virunga Mountains. Their plumes are displaced over a long distance and cause changes to the quality of rainwater, including acidity (pH up to 2), increased concentrations of Fluoride (up to 2,400 mg/L), Chloride (up to 1,750 mg/L) and Sulphide (up to 10,000 mg/L). These events have detrimental effects on the equatorial rainforest and likely impose possible strain

This typically results in ﬂoods and/or lahars (mixtures of melt water and volcanic debris) which can be exceptionally violent and cause large-scale loss of life and destruction to infrastructure (Barr et al., 2018). The most devastating example from recent history occurred in 1985, when the medium-sized eruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, Colombia, produced lahars that killed more than 23,000 people some 70 km downstream (Pierson et al., 1990). Hazards associated with ice and snow-clad volcanoes have been reported mostly from the Cordilleras of the Americas, but also from the Aleutian arc (USA), Mexico, Kamchatka (Russia), Japan, New Zealand and Iceland (Seynova et al., 2017). In particular, under Icelandic glaciers, volcanic activity and eruptions melted large amounts of ice and caused especially large ﬂoods if water accumulated underneath the glacier (Björnsson, 2003; Seneviratne et al., 2012). There is medium conﬁdence  that the overall hazard related to ﬂoods

It is believed that many mountain areas have been becoming increasingly disaster-prone in last few decades, and the frequency of natural disasters in mountain regions also increased (Guha-Sapir et al., 2011; Pathak et al., 2010).In South-East Asia and Oceania subregions volcanic eruptions resulted in complete destruction of ecosystems close to the volcano (https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/index.html).

Atmospheric inversions based on surface and satellite column CO 2 measurements show significant carbon release during drought events in pan-tropic areas (Phillips et al., 2009; Gatti et al., 2014; J. Liu et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019). Regional extreme droughts in the mid-latitudes also decrease GPP and land CO 2 sink (Ciais et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2016; W. Peters et al., 2020; Flach et al., 2021). Droughts are not compensated by equivalent wet anomalies because of the non-linear response of the terrestrial carbon uptake to soil moisture (Green et al., 2019).Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of sensitivity of the land carbon fluxes to droughts.

IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2021, p.4946: 5.3.3.2 Ocean Deoxygenation and its Implications for Greenhouse GasesAs summarized in SROCC (Section  5.2.2.4), there is a  growing consensus that between 1970 and 2010 the open ocean has very likely  lost 0.5–3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000 m depth (Section 2.3.3.6; Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; 718Chapter 5 Global Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles and Feedbacks5Schmidtko  et al.,  2017; Bindoff et al., 2019). Regionally, the equatorial and North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic have shown the greatest oxygen loss of up to 30 mol m–2 per decade (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Warming – via solubility reduction and circulation changes – mixing and respiration are considered the major drivers, with 50% of the oxygen loss for the upper 1000 m of the global oceans attributable to the solubility reduction (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Climate variability also modifies the oxygen loss on

Efficiency also varies with location (Bopp et al. 2013). Between studies, there are substantial differences in the ratio of iron added to carbon  fixed photosynthetically, and in the ratio of iron added to carbon eventually sequestered (Trull et al. 2015), which has implications both for the success of this strategy and its cost. Estimates indicate potentially achievable net sequestration rates of 1–3 GtCO 2 yr–1 for iron fertilisation, translating into cumulative CDR of 100–300 GtCO 2 by 2100 (Ryaboshapko and Revokatova 2015; Minx et al. 2018), whereas OF with macronutrients has a  higher theoretical potential of 5.5  GtCO 2 yr–1 (Harrison 2017; Gattuso et al. 2021).

The fraction of CO 2 removed that remains out of the atmosphere, a measure of CDR effectiveness, decreases slightly with increasing amount of removal ( medium confidence ) and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower CO 2 concentrations ( medium confidence ). {5.6.2.1; Figures 5.32, 5.33, 5.34}The century-scale climate–carbon cycle response to a  CO 2 removal from the atmosphere is not always equal and opposite to the response to a CO 2 emission ( medium confidence ).

(2021).247Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 22wealthy countries may have a similar impact on emissions as high population increases in regions with low per capita emission levels.Developing countries remained major accelerators of global CO2 emissions growth since 2010, mostly driven by increased consumption and production, in particular in East Asia (robust evidence, high agreement) (Jiborn et al. 2020). While energy intensity declined to a  similar extent in countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries over the last 30 years, economic growth has been much stronger in non-OECD countries (González-Torres et al. 2021). This led to an average annual growth rate of 2.8% of CO 2 emissions in these countries, whereas they decreased by 0.3% yr –1 in OECD countries (UNEP 2019). The majority of developed economies reduced both

Altogether, this demonstrates that at a  given level of energy provided, there is large scope to improve service levels for well-being by modifying socio-economic context without increasing energy supply (Figure 5.4).5.2.2.3 Variations in Consumption-based EmissionsThe carbon footprint of a  nation is equal to the direct emissions occurring due to households’ transport, heating and cooking, as well as the impact embodied in the production of all consumed goods and services (Wiedmann and Minx 2008; Davis and Caldeira 2010; Hübler 2017; Vita et al. 2019a). There are large differences in carbon footprints between the poor and the rich. As a result of energy use inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1  tCO 2  cap–1  yr–1, whereas the highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted about 200–300 tCO 2 cap–1 yr–1 (World Bank 2019).

The correlation between human development and emissions is not necessarily coupled in the long term, which implies there is a need to prioritise human well-being and the environment over economic growth (Steinberger et al. 2020). At the interpersonal and community levels, cultural specificities, infrastructure, norms, and relational behaviours differ (Box 5.3). For example, demand for space heating and cooling depends on building materials and designs, urban planning, vegetation, clothing and social norms as well as geography, incomes, and outside temperatures (Brand-Correa et al. 2018; Campbell et al. 2018; Ivanova et al. 2018; IEA 2019b; Dreyfus [END OF SOURCES]

","Activism has played a significant role in reducing global emissions growth, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and global warming. Activist climate movements have brought attention to the links between economic and environmental inequities, collected and publicized data about them, and demanded stronger mitigation (Goodman, 2009, p. 3556; Schlosberg and Collins, 2014, p. 3556; Jafry, 2019, p. 3556).

Since SROCC, evidence of the progress of acidification across all regions of the oceans has been further strengthened by continued observations of seawater carbonate chemistry at ocean time series stations, and compiled shipboard studies providing temporally resolved and methodologically consistent datasets (Jiang et al., 2019) (Figure 5.20; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Section 2.3.3.5).In the subtropical open oceans, decreases in pH have been reported with a  very likely  rate range from –0.016 to –0.019 pH units per decade since 1980s, which equates to approximately 4 % increase in hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) per decade.

This process has caused a shift in the carbonate chemistry towards a  less basic state, commonly referred to as ‘ocean acidification’ (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Orr et al., 2005; Doney et al., 2009). Although the societal concern regarding ocean acidification is relatively recent (about the last 20  years), the physical–chemical basis for the ocean absorption (sink) of atmospheric CO 2 has been discussed much earlier by Revelle and Suess (1957). The AR5 and SROCC assessments were of robust evidence  that the H+ ion concentration is increasing in the surface ocean, thereby reducing seawater pH (= -log [H+]) (Section 2.3.4.1; Orr et al., 2005; Feely et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013; Bindoff et al., 2019), and there is high confidence  that ocean acidification is impacting marine organisms (Bindoff et al., 2019).

As a consequence, the lysocline, i.e. the depth in the ocean below which the rate of dissolution of calcite increases dramatically, could be shallower in polar regions while the decreased rate of pH is expected to be similar to the other latitudes.A recent estimate suggests that all water masses in the Mediterranean Sea are also already acidified (-0.14 to -0.05 pH units; Touratier & Goyet, 2011). Considering the highest values of this range, the Mediterranean Sea appears to be one of the most acidified marine basins in the world. Yet, as far as we know, no estimates of future acidification rates in the Mediterranean Sea have been carried out.4 .7 .2 .6 Trends in atmospheric CO2 concentrationThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is rising with the well-known seasonal pattern, and this trend is accelerating steadily (IPCC, 2013b).

Current acidity is estimated to be the highest since the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago, above levels experienced at least over 800,000 years (Lüthi et al. , 2008). Acidification is most critical for the shallow-water areas over-saturated with calcium carbonate. The highest concentrations of anthropogenic CO2 are in near-surface waters, as mixing of these waters into the deeper oceans can take centuries. About 30% of the anthropogenic CO2 is at depths shallower than 200 m, while nearly 50% is at depths shallower than 400 m (Feely et al. , 2004).

The vulnerability of foundation species as well as keystone species including many echinoderms to ocean acidification will result in ecosystem-level impacts (Dupont et al., 2010; Kroeker et al., 2010). Meta-analyses also suggest that ocean acidification may catalyze changes in the structure of phytoplankton communities, with potential consequences for marine food webs (Dutkiewicz et al., 2015). Acidification is also projected to impact deep-sea species (Levin & Lebris, 2015). In addition, there are a range of expected neurological or behavioral impacts on several commercial and non-commercial fish species, negatively affecting their ability to find suitable settlement locations, predation behaviour, and sensory functions (Branch et al., 2013; Stiasny et al., 2016).

","Ocean acidification is harmful to marine organisms and ecosystems. It negatively affects the survival, calcification, growth, and reproduction of various species, including foundation and keystone species (Kroeker et al., 2010; 2013; Talmage & Gobler, 2010). Ocean acidification can also lead to changes in the structure of phytoplankton communities, potentially impacting marine food webs (Dutkiewicz et al., 2015). It is projected to have detrimental effects on deep-sea species (Levin & Lebris, 2015) and can result in neurological and behavioral impacts on fish species, affecting their settlement locations, predation behavior, and sensory functions (Branch et al., 2013; Stiasny et al., 2016). The impacts of ocean acidification are expected to emerge in specific fisheries by 2030 (Punt et al., 2015; Rheuban et al., 2018; Hänsel et al., 2020; Lam et al., 2016). Additionally, ocean acidification hinders the ability of calcifying organisms to build and maintain their calcium carbonate structures, such as coral skeletons and shells, and can contribute to coral bleaching (Gattuso et al., 2015; Six et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2017a). Therefore, based on the available sources, it can be concluded that ocean acidification is indeed harmful (IPBES, 2018, p.3072; IPCC, 2022, p.2924; IPCC, 2022, p.3017; IPBES, 2021, p.3071).","Yes, ocean acidification is harmful. It negatively affects marine organisms and their functions, hindering the ability of calcifying organisms to build and maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons and shells, and altering other fundamental metabolic processes (202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2022, p.1033). It is projected to have detrimental effects on specific fisheries by 2030 (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.3329). It also has expected neurological or behavioral impacts on several commercial and non-commercial fish species, negatively affecting their ability to find suitable settlement locations, predation behaviour, and sensory functions (202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2018, p.3072). Furthermore, ocean acidification poses a key threat to many species including habitat-forming species like corals, oysters and mussels, which are expected to have decreased survival, calcification, growth, and reproduction (202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2021, p.3071)."

International trade plays a central role, being responsible for shifting burdens in most cases from low-income developing countries producers to high-income developed countries as consumers (Wiedmann et  al. 2020). China is the largest exporter to the EU and United States, and accounts for nearly half and 40% of their imports in energy use respectively (Wu et al. 2019). Wealthy countries have exported or outsourced their climate and energy crisis to low- and middle-income countries (Baker 2018), exacerbated by intensive international trade (Steinberger et  al. 2012; Scherer et  al. 2018).

Energy consumption has been rising since the industrial revolution. Wood and oil from whales were replaced in the early 1900s by coal, petroleum and natural gas (Smil, 2004). By the middle of the 20th Century, the “Green Revolution” boosted agricultural yields through the application of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and herbicides, together with irrigation, all of which increased energy demands (Dzioubinski & Chipman, 1999). Total energy use has doubled in the last 40 years (World Bank, 2018g) (Figure S6), while substantial transitions to modern gridded clean fuels occurred between 1990 and 2010 (Pachauri et al., 2012), allowing ~1.7 billion people access to electricity and about ~1.6 billion people access to non-solid fuels for household cooking. The greatest increases have occurred in middle income countries, while low income countries exhibited lower increases (Figure
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.398: Developed Countries contributed 57%, and least developed countries contributed 0.4%. (Figure TS.5) {2.2, Figures 2.9 and 2.10}Globally, households with income in the top 10% contribute about 36–45% of global GHG emissions  (robust evidence, medium agreement). About two thirds of the top 10% live in Developed Countries and one third in other economies.

Altogether, this demonstrates that at a  given level of energy provided, there is large scope to improve service levels for well-being by modifying socio-economic context without increasing energy supply (Figure 5.4).5.2.2.3 Variations in Consumption-based EmissionsThe carbon footprint of a  nation is equal to the direct emissions occurring due to households’ transport, heating and cooking, as well as the impact embodied in the production of all consumed goods and services (Wiedmann and Minx 2008; Davis and Caldeira 2010; Hübler 2017; Vita et al. 2019a). There are large differences in carbon footprints between the poor and the rich. As a result of energy use inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1  tCO 2  cap–1  yr–1, whereas the highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted about 200–300 tCO 2 cap–1 yr–1 (World Bank 2019).

An important factor is that many mitigation policies involve investments in low-carbon or energy-efficient technology, the savings from which persist.

One estimate of the total reduction in annual GHG emissions – from peak years to 2018 – sums to 3.2 GtCO 2-eq across all decarbonising countries (Lamb et al. 2021a).

However, climate policy related reductions may be even larger when compared against a counterfactual case of emissions growth across different sectors (Eskander and Fankhauser 2020) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1; Section 2.8).The recent (2010–2019) emissions changes of some countries are in line with pathways that limit warming to below 2°C (<67%) (e.g., –4% average annual reductions) (Figure 2.10).

While energy intensity declined to a  similar extent in countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries over the last 30 years, economic growth has been much stronger in non-OECD countries (González-Torres et al. 2021).

Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources of  funding emerging either through international organisations, or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding streams (Henderson et al. 2020).Risk and uncertainty.

In between, some models consider imperfect or adaptive expectations, where economic decisions are based on past, current and imperfectly anticipated future information (Keppo and Strubegger 2010; Kriegler et al. 2015a; Löffler et al. 2019). Modelling tools can also be differentiated by their level of representation of economic agents and sectors: they can have a  full representation of all agents of the economy and their interactions with each other (general equilibrium) or focus on a more detailed representation of a subset of economic sectors

One, as pioneered by Nordhaus (1992, 2008) attempts to monetise overall climate damages and mitigation costs so as to strike a ‘cost-benefit optimum’ pathway. More detailed and empirically-grounded ‘cost-effectiveness analysis’ explores pathways that would minimise mitigation costs (Ekholm 2014; IPCC 2014a Section  2.5; Weyant 2017) for given targets (e.g.,  as agreed in international negotiations, see Section 3.2 in Chapter 3).

Since AR5, hybrid approaches have taken different forms to integrate process, statistical and/or structural methods, and represent a potentially promising means of leveraging the strengths of different approaches (e.g., Moore and Diaz, 2015; and Hsiang et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2017a; Ricke et al., 2018; Yumashev et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b).

Such methods are perceived as objective when dealing with tangibles, but are more controversial in their valuing of intangibles. Since these methods model uncertainties with probabilities and then work with expectations, they share much in common with Bayesian methods.

In fact, while economic policies play a significant role in influencing people’s decisions and behaviour, many drivers of human behaviour and values work largely outside the market system (Winkler et al. 2015; Díaz et al. 2019) as actors in society, particularly individuals, do not respond in an economically ‘rational’ manner based on perfect-information cost-benefit analyses (Runge 1984; Shiller 2019). Rather, compelling narratives can drive individuals to adopt new norms and policies. And norms can be more quickly and more robustly shifted by proposing and framing policies designed with awareness of how framings interact with individual cognitive tendencies (van der Linden et al. 2015). Transformative policies are thus much more likely to be successfully adopted and lead to long-term behavioural change if designed in accordance with principles of cognitive psychology (van [END OF SOURCES]

Additionally, there is a divide between conservatives and liberals regarding moral intuitions, with conservatives having moral intuitions that liberals may not recognize (Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize, 2018, p.98). These divisions highlight the complexity and diversity of opinions and ideology within the field of economics.","Economists' opinions and ideologies diverge in their understanding and interpretation of human behavior and decision-making processes.

Research has shown that if there is low public trust in utility companies, service delivery by community-based non-profit organisations in the US (Stern et  al. 1985) or public/private partnerships in Mexico (Friedmann and Sheinbaum 1998), offer more effective solutions, yet only if public trust is higher in these types of organisations.

","The economists' standard economic recommendation to curb greenhouse gas emissions is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase energy efficiency (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.4138). This can be achieved by implementing policies and measures that promote the adoption of renewable energy sources and technologies (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.4022). Additionally, economists emphasize the importance of implementing carbon pricing mechanisms, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, to incentivize the reduction of emissions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.1816). These recommendations aim to align economic incentives with environmental goals and encourage the transition to a low-carbon economy (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.2662).","Economists recommend the transformation of the global financial and economic system towards sustainability as a standard economic measure to curb greenhouse gas emissions (202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2022, p.6445).

Second, trade-offs and synergies require assessment of supply, demand and use together and not separately (Geijzendorffer, Martín-López, & Roche, 2015). Following Turkelboom et al. (2016) a trade-off is a situation where one use or practice directly decreases the benefits supplied by another. A synergy is a situation where one use or practice directly increases the benefits supplied by another use or practice. Both synergies and trade-offs have spatial and temporal dimensions (see section 3.2).Trade-offs may depict an array of phenomena including conflicts, contestations, negative correlations, incompatibilities, rivalry and excludability in relation to

Trade-offs are distinct from synergies (the latter are also referred to as “win-win” scenarios): synergies arise when the enhancement of one desirable outcome leads to enhancement of  another.TransformationIn an organizational context, it refers to profound and radical change that orients an organization in a new direction and takes it to an entirely different level of  effectiveness.UUncertaintyAny situation in which the current state of knowledge is such  that:• the order or nature of things is unknown,  • the consequences, extent, or magnitude of circumstances, conditions, or events is

Traded goods can be assumed as perfectly substitutable between regions of origin (Heckscher-Ohlin assumption), such as is often the case for energy commodities, or as imperfectly substitutable (e.g., Armington goods) for non-energy goods. The representation of trade and capital imbalances at the regional level and their evolution through time vary across models and imbalances are either not considered (regional current accounts are balanced at each point in time), or a constraint for intertemporal balance is included (an export surplus today will be balanced by an import surplus in the future), or else trade imbalances follow other rules such as a  convergence towards zero in the long run (Foure et al. 2020).Strategic interaction can also occur between regions, especially in the presence of externalities such as climate change, energy prices

But primarily due to the moderate carbon price assumptions (Figure 3.31b), the reductions in emissions and particular fossil fuel use are markedly smaller than what would be obtained in the case of immediate action. The assessment shows that accelerated action until 2030 can have significant benefits in terms of reducing the mitigation challenges from following the NDCs until 2030. But putting a significant value on GHG emissions reductions globally remains a key element of moving onto  1.5°C–2°C pathways. The vast majority of pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, independently of their differences in near-term emission developments, converge to a global mitigation regime putting a significant value on GHG emission reductions in all regions and sectors.3.6 Economics of Long-term Mitigation

For the whole economy, the interquartile range of estimated mitigation costs is between 140 USD2015 and 340 USD2015 tCO 2–1 in 2050 in scenarios limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) and between 430 USD2015 and 990 USD2015 tCO 2–1 in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Chapter 3). For energy sectors in various regions and globally, different scenarios show a  wide range of implied carbon prices in 2050 to limit warming to 1.5°C, from below USD50 tCO 2–1 to more than USD900 tCO 2–1 (Brouwer et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Mitigation costs for scenarios limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) were 3–11% in consumption losses in AR5, but the median in newer studies is about 3% in GDP losses (Su et al. 2018; Gambhir et al. 2019).

Land-use changes can create biodiversity-related externalities by weakening life-supporting, regulating and cultural services, thereby inducing biodiversity loss . One way of addressing such negative environmental externalities is to develop policies for implementing compensation mechanisms (e .g ., taxation) .

The main reason for the decline was an improvement in the carbon intensity of traded products, rather than a decline in trade volume (Wood et al. 2020a). Despite continued improvements, developing economies tend to have higher emission intensity than developed economies due to less efficient technologies and a carbon-intensive fuel mix (Jiang and Guan 2017).2.3.4.2 Geographical Shifts of Emissions Embodied in TradeWith the rapid growth of developing countries, the geographical centre of global trade as well as emissions embodies in trade is

Here as well, theory suggests that there are benefits from cooperation on technology development at the regional or sectoral levels, but also that cooperation on technology, especially for breakthrough technologies, may prove to be easier than for abatement (El-Sayed and Rubio 2014; Rubio 2017). In a dynamic context, the combination of infrastructure lock-in, network effects with high switching cost, and dynamic market failures suggests that deployment and adoption of clean technologies is path dependent (Acemoglu et al. 2012; Aghion et al. 2014), with a  multiplicity of possible equilibria.

Nordhaus (2011) argues that these two problems would have to be tackled separately: once the favourable intellectual property right regimes (i.e., the laws or rules or regulation on protection and enforcement) are in place, a price on carbon that corrects the emission externality is sufficient to induce optimal level of green technological change. Acemoglu et al. (2012) demonstrates that subsidising clean technologies (and not dirty ones) is also necessary to break the lock-in of dirty technological change.

The sources indicate that achieving net zero GHG emissions is the goal of mitigation efforts (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.1186). While reducing anthropogenic GHG emissions is necessary to limit global warming (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.1186), the sources also suggest that reaching net zero emissions does not necessarily require an immediate and complete cessation of all or most GHGs. Reaching net zero emissions can lead to temperature stabilization (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2021, p.6515), and the effectiveness of GHG mitigation strategies can be enhanced by combining various instruments and interventions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.3732). Therefore, the optimal global response involves a combination of measures and a gradual reduction of GHG emissions rather than an immediate and complete curtailing of all or most GHGs.","The optimal global response involves reducing anthropogenic GHG emissions towards net zero to limit warming, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.1186). Current nationally stated mitigation ambitions under the Paris Agreement would not limit global warming to 1.5°C, even with challenging increases in emissions reductions after 2030 (SPM_version_report_LR, 2018, p.78). Achieving net zero GHG emissions typically results in global temperatures peaking and then declining, although this outcome depends on the sequencing of mitigation of short-lived and long-lived species (IPCC_AR6_WGI_FullReport, 2021, p.6515). Effective mitigation strategies require an understanding of mechanisms that underpin release of emissions, and the technical, policy and societal options for influencing these (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.1186).

IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.12884: feasible policies and equity issues (Executive Summary in Chapter 1).IAMs and macroeconomic models typically calculate mitigation costs based on the assumption that markets internalise externalities like GHG emissions through carbon prices (Barker et al. 2016; IEA 2017, 2019). Yet, there are legitimate questions to be asked about whether carbon pricing will be efficient if markets are inefficient (World Bank 2019). However, market inefficiencies are difficult to integrate into the models. How GHG emissions taxes would actually work is thus quite uncertain based on the modelling studies (Barker et al. 2016; Fontana and Sawyer 2016; Meyer et al. 2018). Despite these limitations, the use of GHG emission taxes as an effective instrument based on modelling results in practice has implications for public policies and private-sector investments.Despite the shortcomings of conventional economic thought and models already pointed out, improved models have demonstrated

IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.1705: Solutions Act, reduced CO 2 emissions by 2.7–25% of the average state-level annual emissions from the power sector over the period 1990–2014 in the USA. Mandatory GHG registry/reporting, electric decoupling and a public benefit fund have been effective in further decreasing power sector emissions in the USA (Martin and Saikawa 2017). In the UK electricity sector, a carbon price floor, combined with electricity market reform (competitive auctions for both firm capacity and renewable energy), displaced coal, whose share fell from 46% in 1995 to 7% in 2017, halving CO 2 emissions, while renewables grew from under 4% in 2008 to 22% by 2017 (Grubb and Newbery 2018). See Chapter 13 for more information.An alternative approach to a carbon tax is an indirect emissions tax on fuels such as an excise tax, or on vehicles, based on the expected CO2 intensity of new passenger vehicles. Vehicle purchase taxes can result in a  reduction in GHG emissions through reducing the

However the absence of GHG prices can also been perceived as a  subsidy for fossil fuel-based production (Stiglitz 2006; Al Khourdajie and Finus 2020; Kuusi et al. 2020). Another argument supporting CBAM implementation is the possibility to induce low-GHG investment in non-regulated regions (Cosbey et al. 2019).Thus far, California is the only jurisdiction that has implemented CBA tariffs applied on electricity imports from neighbouring states and provides insights on how a CBA can work in practice by using ‘default’ GHG emissions intensity benchmarks (Fowlie et al. 2021).

IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.20925: social benefits of reducing carbon emissions through cost-benefit analyses to make the intended regulation acceptable.TaxesCarbon taxes represent another financial mechanism for addressing climate change (Metcalf, 2019), 2019b). For example, the implementation of a carbon tax and a value-added tax on transport fuel in Sweden resulted in a reduction of CO 2 emissions from transport of about 11%, of which the carbon tax had the largest share (Andersson, 2019). In the USA, for example, a carbon tax could increase fiscal flexibility by collecting new revenues that can be redeployed to finance reforms and help stimulate economic growth. However, US tax-inclusive energy prices would have to be 273% higher than laissez-faire levels in 2055 in order to meet international agreements (Casey, 2019). Similarly, limiting global warming to 2°C or less would likely require a carbon tax rate in the Asia/Pacific region
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.3081: agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a  slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers.There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental effects (e.g., Bachus et al. (2019) for Belgium, and Beiser-McGrath
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2021, p.20926: agreements (Casey, 2019). Similarly, limiting global warming to 2°C or less would likely require a carbon tax rate in the Asia/Pacific region to be significantly higher than USD 25 per ton (IMF , 2021). Therefore, using tax revenues to issue payments back to taxpayers that are disproportionately impacted, or to redistribute capital among regions, may be one of the most important features of carbon tax policies. Although the average effect of carbon tax on welfare would be positive, some regions (56%) will gain and some regions (44%) lose (Scobie, 2013). Therefore, large transfer payments are needed to compensate those losing from carbon tax (Krusell and Smith, 2018).The International Monetary Fund (IMF (2019) argues that, of the various mitigation strategies to reduce fossil fuel CO 2 emissions, carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient, because they allow firms and households to find the lowest-cost ways of reducing energy use and shifting towards cleaner alternatives.

Where the tax revenue is treated as general revenue the government relies on existing income redistribution policies (such as income taxes) and social safety net programmes to address the distributional impacts.Carbon taxes on fossil fuels have effects similar to the removal of fossil fuel subsidies (Ohlendorf et al. 2021) (Section 13.6.3.6). Even if a carbon tax is progressive it increases prices for fuels, electricity, transport, food and other goods and services that adversely affect the most economically vulnerable. Redistribution of tax revenue is critical to address the adverse impacts on low-income groups (Dorband et al. 2019) (Box 5.11).

Similar perceptions have been reported among a diversity of rural communities in many sub-Saharan African countries (Mahl et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a).Rural communities, particularly farmers, are the most studied groups for climate change perception. They perceive the climate to be changing, most often reporting changes in rainfall variability, increased dry spells, decreases in rainfall and increased temperatures or temperature extremes. They perceive these changes to bring a range of negative socioeconomic and environmental effects (Alemayehu and Bewket, 2017; Liverpool-Tasie et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a). In some cases, farmers’ perceptions of changes in weather and climate frequently match climate records for decreased precipitation totals, increased drought frequency, shorter rainy season and rainy season delay, and increased temperatures (Figure 9.11; Rurinda et al., 2014;
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.9529: although evidence is somewhat mixed in terms of how experiences of weather affect opinions and perceptions of climate change (Howe et  al., 2019). Research also highlights the importance of context in understanding relations between perceptions of risks and behaviour, arguing that power relations and other obstacles and opportunities play a vital role in shaping actions (Rufat et  al., 2020). In general, nonetheless, adaptation is spurred when people perceive that there is an action they can take to make a difference (Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011; Mayer and Smith, 2019), although it cannot be assumed that action will be taken if the socio-cultural setting is not amenable and it contravenes the values underlying people’s perceptions (Kwon et al., 2019).

Personal experience of climate-related changes and their impacts appears to be an important factor influencing perceptions through shaping negative associations, for example, experience of flash floods (Elshirbiny and Abrahamse, 2020) or direct effect on economic activity, indicating that perception is not restricted to crop farmers (Liverpool-Tasie et  al., 2020).

Focusing on individual sectors, the average country-level cost is projected to be USD 0.8 billion per year for adapting to temperature-related mortality under 4°C global warming (Carleton et al., 2018), with cumulative energy costs for cooling demand projected to reach USD 51 billion by 2°C and USD 486 billion by 4°C global warming (Parkes et  al., 2019). Transport infrastructure repair costs are also projected to be substantial (Section  9.8.2) More precise estimates are limited by methodological difficulties and data gaps for costing adaptation, uncertainties about future levels of global warming and associated climate hazards, and ethical choices such as the desired level of protection achieved (Fankhauser, 2010; Hallegatte et al., 2018; UNFCCC,
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2021, p.19879: across all countries, as is sometimes interpreted in the literature and media. As shown below in this Cross-Chapter Box, the estimated cost of adaptation for developing countries ranges from 15 to 411 billion USD yr−1 for climate change impacts out to 2030, with the majority of estimates being well above 100 billion.Proposed sources for the developed country commitment included ‘a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance’ and several instruments including grants and loans. Nonetheless, there remain differences of opinion on the types of finance that should count towards this goal, with several issues identified (high confidence) (Bodnar et al., 2015; Bhattacharya et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2021), including: (i) counting non-grant finance, such as market and concessional loans (public and private), where developing countries ultimately have to repay the investment; (ii)
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.9480: of climate change (Gitz et al., 2015).Behind each policy are decisions about the magnitude of financial resource investments in specific adaptation actions, and their allocation between different sectors and groups in society, both spatially and temporally. The IPCC has estimated that limiting the rise in global average surface temperatures to 1.5°C would require between USD 1.6 trillion to USD 3.8 trillion of annual investment in supply-side energy systems (those that generate energy) between 2016 and 2050 (IPCC, 2018b). Resource allocations, however, are shaped by perceptions of the risks of climate change and the urgency of actions, as well as other motivational factors such as descriptive norms and perceived self-efficacy (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) and the underlying approaches taken to valuing human well-being (e.g., see work from Bhutan on Gross National Happiness and climate change actions (Kamei et al., 2021)).

There is, hence, high agreement that better assessment of adaptation costs of climate impacts requires considerably more research (Watkiss, 2015; Diaz and Moore, 2017). A recent study focusing on investments needed to offset the effects of climate change on the prevalence of hunger concludes that investments in agricultural research and development (R&D) have to increase from USD 1.62 billion to USD 2.77 billion per year between 2015 and 2050 (Sulser et al., 2021a). In addition to agricultural R&D, significant investment increases in water and infrastructure in the range of USD 12.7 billion and USD 10.8  billion are required, respectively, a considerable portion of which is relevant to the food system. In total, Sulser et al. (2021a) estimate that annual investment between USD 21.47  billion and USD 29.8  billion are needed to avoid sliding back from climate-
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.2812: reducing climate risk (O’Neill et al. 2020). Thus there is an adaptation gap (UNEP 2018a), and bridging that gap requires enablers including institutional capacity, planning and investment (UNEP 2016). Estimates of adaptation costs vary greatly across studies. Recent studies based on climate change under RCP8.5 report adaptation costs for developing countries of up to 400 billion (300 billion in RCP2.6) USD2005 in 2030 (New et al. 2020). Of the NDCs submitted in 2015, 50 countries estimated adaptation costs of USD39 billion annually. Both public and private finance for adaptation is increasing, but remains insufficient and constitutes a small fraction (4–8%) of total climate finance which is mostly aimed at mitigation. The pledge of developed countries of mobilising finance for developing countries to address adaptation needs globally as part of the Paris Agreement are insufficient.

The IPCC has estimated that limiting the rise in global average surface temperatures to 1.5°C would require between USD 1.6 trillion to USD 3.8 trillion of annual investment in supply-side energy systems (those that generate energy) between 2016 and 2050 (IPCC, 2018b). Resource allocations, however, are shaped by perceptions of the risks of climate change and the urgency of actions, as well as other motivational factors such as descriptive norms and perceived self-efficacy (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) and the underlying approaches taken to valuing human well-being (e.g., see work from Bhutan on Gross National Happiness and climate change actions (Kamei et al., 2021)).

Warming between 1.5°C and 2°C could expose 330–396 million people to lower agricultural yields and associated livelihood impacts (Byers et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a), due to a high dependency of climate-sensitive livelihoods to agriculture globally (World Bank, 2020). Models project that climate change will increase the number of people at risk of hunger in 2050 by 8–80 million people globally, with the range depending on the level of warming (1.5–2.9°C) and SSPs (Nelson et al., 2018; Mbow et al., 2019; Janssens et al., 2020).

Nevertheless, some benefits of climate change adaptation include improved disaster preparedness, the accumulation of social assets, economic benefits of agricultural diversification and benefits associated with migration, as well as the political benefits of collective action (Pelling et al., 2018). In contrast, wealthier tiers of society facing climate change impacts are more able to liquidate assets to avoid losses from climate change, to be formally compensated for losses (Fang et al., 2019) and employ social positions to leverage gains from adaptation (Nadiruzzaman and Wrathall, 2015).The poor frequently suffer the direct and indirect impacts of climate change, including the cost of adopting adaptive measures (Atteridge
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.3475: 2020a). If changes in some preference behaviours, for example for larger homes and work environments to enable home working and online education, lead to sprawling suburbs or gentrification with linked environmental consequences, this could translate into long-term implications for climate change (Beaunoyer et al. 2020; Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). Recovering from the pandemic by adopting low energy demand practices – embedded in new travel, work, consumption and production behaviour and patterns – could reduce carbon prices for a 1.5°C consistent pathway by 19%, reduce energy supply investments until 2030 by USD1.8 trillion, and lessen pressure on the upscaling of low-carbon energy technologies (Kikstra et al. 2021a).COVID-19 drove hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds, reversing decades of poverty reduction accomplishments (Krieger

Severe adverse impacts of climate change at present and future risks may result from permanent, sudden, destabilising changes accompanying climate events such as decreases in food security, large-scale migration, changes in labour capacity or conflict (Bentley et al., 2014).

Two global projections of climate change health impacts have been conducted since AR5. The first focused on cause-specific mortality for eight exposures for 2030 and 2050 for a mid-range emissions scenario (A1b) and three scenarios of economic growth (WHO, 2014). The study estimated that the climate change projected to occur by 2050 (compared to 1961–1990) could result in an excess of approximately 250,000 deaths yr–1, dominated by increases in deaths due to heat (94,000, mainly in Asia and high-income countries), childhood undernutrition (85,000, mainly in Africa but also in Asia), malaria (33,000, mainly in Africa) and diarrhoeal disease (33,000, mainly in Africa and Asia). Overall, more than half of this excess mortality is projected for Africa. Near-term projections (for 2030) are predominantly for childhood undernutrition (95,200 out of 241,000 total excess deaths)

Generally, climate change poses a threat to water and food security, and is expected to lead to an increase in extreme events that may, in turn, cause human migration (‘climate refugees’) from storms, floods, and wildfires, particularly in urban settings (Patz et al., 2005). The impacts of climate refugees for countries in the Americas will be felt both for those sending out and receiving refugees. Increases in human mortality rates between the mid-1970s and 2000 due to climate change are estimated to range from 0-70 deaths per million people in the Americas; this risk is projected to more than double by 2030 (Patz et al., 2005).

Different sets of beliefs can shape climate-related policies, targets, and instruments (Boasson and Wettestad 2013; Boasson 2015; Boasson et al. 2021). First, beliefs link climate governance with social justice concerns; policies, targets and instruments may therefore reflect justice issues (Fuller and McCauley 2016; Reckien et al. 2017; McCauley and Heffron 2018; Routledge et al. 2018; Bäckstrand and Lövbrand 2006, 2019).

Effective environmental regulations that also deliver co-benefits for climate mitigation require integrated policies (Schmale et  al. 2014; Haines et  al. 2017).

It is therefore not possible to separate emissions into two clearly distinct groups. As a result, policies aiming at addressing climate change may have benefits or side effects for air quality, and vice versa. For example, some short-term ‘win-win’ policies that simultaneously improve air quality and limit climate change include the implementation of energy efficiency measures, methane capture and recovery from solid-waste management and the oil and gas industry, zero-emissions vehicles, efficient and clean stoves for heating and cooking, filtering of soot (particulate matter) for diesel vehicles, cleaner brick-kiln technology, practices that

The over dominance of the influence of the state can also be an issue for marginalized groups, such as indigenous communities and their rights. For example, indigenous communities including the Torres Strait islanders and the Sami were forced to take their governments to court to maintain their constitutional rights to fish (Lantto & Mörkenstam, 2008).

Van Welie and Romijn (2018) show that, in a low-income setting, the exclusion of some local stakeholders from the decision-making process may undermine sustainability transitions efforts. Countries with high levels of inequality can be more prone to elite capture, non-transparent political decision-making processes, relations based on clientelism and patronage, and no independent judiciary (Jasanoff 2018), although in particular contexts, non-elites manage to exert influence (Moldalieva and Heathershaw 2020).

The transition has led to social unrest in some cases, especially where there is a culture of entitlement to low-cost energy because it is an indigenous resource. Such reforms have been more effective when governments have been able to clearly show how savings are applied to social and health programs that benefit human well-being.

Technology adoption, particularly banning combustion and diesel engines and 100% EV targets (and other zero-carbon fuels, especially in freight) and efficient lightweight cars, can contribute to between 30% and 70% of GHG emissions reduction from land transport in 2050, with 50% as our central estimate (see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2 and Chapter 10, Sections 10.4 and 10.7), consistent with scenario modelling (Figure  10.27) and based on rapid reduction in the GHG emission footprint of vehicle production.

The AR5 noted that mitigation effort and the costs associated with ambitious mitigation differ significantly across countries, and in ‘globally cost-effective’ scenarios, the biggest reductions (relative to projections) occur in the countries with the highest future emissions in the baseline scenarios (IPCC 2014b, p. 17). Since most physical capital (e.g.,  power plants, buildings, transport infrastructure) involved in GHG emissions is long-lived, the timing of the shift in investments and strategies will be crucial (IPCC 2014b, p. 18).

It shows that urgent action is needed. Unless there are immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will be beyond reach. Global greenhouse gas emissions implied by Nationally Determined Contributions announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C and will also make it harder to limit warming to below 2°C.But there are positive signs and increased evidence of climate action.

Similarly, limiting global warming to 2°C or less would likely require a carbon tax rate in the Asia/Pacific region to be significantly higher than USD 25 per ton (IMF , 2021). Therefore, using tax revenues to issue payments back to taxpayers that are disproportionately impacted, or to redistribute capital among regions, may be one of the most important features of carbon tax policies. Although the average effect of carbon tax on welfare would be positive, some regions (56%) will gain and some regions (44%) lose (Scobie, 2013). Therefore, large transfer payments are needed to compensate those losing from carbon tax (Krusell and Smith, 2018).The International Monetary Fund (IMF (2019) argues that, of the various mitigation strategies to reduce fossil fuel CO 2 emissions, carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient, because they allow firms and households to find the lowest-cost ways of reducing energy use and shifting towards cleaner alternatives.
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.3081: agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a  slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers.There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental effects (e.g., Bachus et al.

Several studies explore the impact of a carbon tax on green innovation (Section 16.4). However, disentangling the effect of policy tools is complex because the presence of some policies could distort the functioning of other policies (Böhringer and Rosendahl 2010; Fischer et al. 2017) and because the impact of policies could be lagged in time (Antosiewicz and Witajewski-Baltvilks 2021).The direction of technological change depends also on the market size for dirty technologies relative to the size of other markets (Acemoglu et al. 2014). Due to this dependence, climate and trade policy choices in a single region can alter the direction of technological change at the global level (Section 16.2.3.3).The value of the market for clean technologies is determined not only

Importantly, evidence of potential negative outcomes due to rebound effects, induced demand, or life-cycle trade-offs can also be observed. For example, telework has been shown to reduce emissions where long and/or energy-intensive commutes are avoided, but can lead to net emissions increases in cases where greater non-work vehicle use occurs or only short, low-emissions commutes (e.g., via public transit) are avoided (Hook et al.

The revenues from carbon taxes can be reallocated for low-carbon investments, supporting poorer sections of society, and fostering technological change (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.11651). However, the implementation of a carbon tax could have varying effects on different regions, with some gaining and others losing, necessitating large transfer payments to compensate those negatively impacted (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.20926)."

IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2019, p.20926: agreements (Casey, 2019). Similarly, limiting global warming to 2°C or less would likely require a carbon tax rate in the Asia/Pacific region to be significantly higher than USD 25 per ton (IMF , 2021). Therefore, using tax revenues to issue payments back to taxpayers that are disproportionately impacted, or to redistribute capital among regions, may be one of the most important features of carbon tax policies. Although the average effect of carbon tax on welfare would be positive, some regions (56%) will gain and some regions (44%) lose (Scobie, 2013). Therefore, large transfer payments are needed to compensate those losing from carbon tax (Krusell and Smith, 2018).The International Monetary Fund (IMF (2019) argues that, of the various mitigation strategies to reduce fossil fuel CO 2 emissions, carbon taxes are the most powerful and efficient, because they allow firms and households to find the lowest-cost ways of reducing energy use and shifting towards cleaner alternatives.
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.3081: agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a  slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In countries that export carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers.There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental effects (e.g., Bachus et al. (2019) for Belgium, and Beiser-McGrath
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.8651: and producer investment decisions has been a  major strategy promoted by economists and considered by policymakers to mitigate emissions cost-effectively and to incentivise low-GHG innovations in a purportedly technology neutral way (Stiglitz et al. 2017; Boyce 2018). In the absence of a coordinated effort, individual countries, regions and cities have implemented carbon-pricing schemes. As of 23 August 2021, 64 carbon schemes have been implemented or are scheduled by law for implementation, covering 22.5% of global GHG emissions (World Bank 2020), 35 of which are carbon taxes, primarily implemented on a national level and 29 of which are emissions trading schemes, spread across national and sub-national jurisdictions.Assessments of pricing mechanisms show generally that they lead to reduced emissions, even in sectors that receive free allocation such as industry (Martin et al. 2016; Haites et al. 2018; Narassimhan
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2022, p.20925: social benefits of reducing carbon emissions through cost-benefit analyses to make the intended regulation acceptable.TaxesCarbon taxes represent another financial mechanism for addressing climate change (Metcalf, 2019), 2019b). For example, the implementation of a carbon tax and a value-added tax on transport fuel in Sweden resulted in a reduction of CO 2 emissions from transport of about 11%, of which the carbon tax had the largest share (Andersson, 2019). In the USA, for example, a carbon tax could increase fiscal flexibility by collecting new revenues that can be redeployed to finance reforms and help stimulate economic growth. However, US tax-inclusive energy prices would have to be 273% higher than laissez-faire levels in 2055 in order to meet international agreements (Casey, 2019). Similarly, limiting global warming to 2°C or less would likely require a carbon tax rate in the Asia/Pacific region [END OF SOURCES]

Policies to protect the stratospheric ozone layer is a  case in point. Implementing the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, emissions of controlled ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) (those covered by the protocol) declined to a very low level of about 1.4 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 by 2010, avoiding GHG emissions of an estimated 13.3–16.7 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 (9.7–12.5 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 when accounting for the ozone depletion and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) offsets) (Velders et  al. 2007).

The 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Montreal Protocol) is the leading example of a  non-climate MEA with significant implications for mitigating climate change (Barrett 2008). The Montreal Protocol regulates a  number of substances that are both ozone-depleting substances (ODS) and GHGs with a significant global warming potential (GWP), including chlorofluorocarbons, halons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). As a  result, implementation of phase-out requirements for these substances under the Montreal Protocol has made a  significant

Geden (2016) and Dubash (2020) offer more nuanced assessments.International collaboration works best if an agreement can be made self-reinforcing with incentives for mutual gains and joint action (Barrett 2016; Keohane and Victor 2016), but the structure of the climate challenge makes this hard to achieve.

International cooperation is also vital for the creation and diffusion of norms and the framework for stabilising expectations among actors (Pettenger 2016).Some key roles of the UNFCCC have been detailed by its former heads (Kinley et al. 2021). In addition to specific agreements (most recently the PA) it has enhanced transparency through reporting and data, and generated or reinforced several important norms for global climate action including the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities, and the precautionary principles for maintaining global cooperation among states with unevenly distributed emissions sources, climate impacts, and varying mitigation costs across countries (Keohane and Victor, 2016).

IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.1039: 2016). In addition to formal negotiations, the annual Conference of the Parties (COPs) have increased awareness, and motivated more ambitious actions, sometimes through the formation of ‘coalitions of the willing’, for example. It provides a  structure for measuring and monitoring action towards a global goal (Milkoreit and Haapala 2019). International cooperation (including the UNFCCC) can also promote technology development and transfer and capacity building; mobilise finance for mitigation and adaptation; and help address concerns on climate justice (Okereke and Coventry 2016; Chan et al. 2018) (Chapters 14–16).A common criticism of international institutions is their limited (if any) powers to enforce compliance (Zahar 2017).

The degree to which countries are willing to increase the ambition and secure the achievement of their NDCs over time will be an important indicator of the success of the Paris Agreement; evidence of this was expected by the end of 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the process of updating NDCs.

To some extent, arguments on both sides are aligned with different analytic frameworks, including assumptions about the main barriers to mitigation that international cooperation can help overcome.

Among the 64 carbon-price schemes implemented worldwide today, only nine have carbon prices above USD40 (World Bank 2020). These are all based in Europe and include EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) (above USD40 since March 2021), Switzerland ETS, and seven countries with carbon taxes. Furthermore, emissions-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries are typically allowed exemptions and receive provisions that shelter them from any

An analysis of 315 local authority emission-reduction plans reveals that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures (Palermo et al. 2020a). Estimates of emission reductions by non-state and sub-state actors in 10 high-emitting economies projected GHG emissions in 2030 would be 1.2–2.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 or 3.8–5.5% lower compared to scenario projections for current national policies (31.6–36.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) if the policies are fully implemented and do not change the pace of action elsewhere (Kuramochi et al. 2020).

Companies can set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement goals through science-based targets (SBTs) and develop internal strategies to achieve these targets (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.8685). Additionally, some countries require companies to report their emissions, which can create transparency and accountability (Mason et al., 2016). Implementing actions such as shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, changing food systems, electrifying transport, and improving energy efficiency can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2020, p.3160).

Although divestment is hailed as a  necessary action to decouple fossil fuel from growth and force carbon-intensive industries to go out of business, there is the sense that there is no shortage of investors who are willing to buy shares, so that such resources are not stranded, but simply relocated. Criticism has been levelled at the divestment movement for not having a significant impact on funding fossil fuels and not being sufficiently in tune with other wide-ranging complexities that go beyond the moral dimensions (Bergman 2018). Despite being labelled a ‘moral entrepreneur’, the divestment movement has the potential to disrupt 1745Accelerating the Transition in the Context of Sustainable Development Chapter 1717current practices in the fossil fuel industry, shape a  ‘disruptive innovation’ and contribute to a strategy for decarbonising economies globally (Bergman 2018).

Divestment is contributing to the political situation that is ‘weakening the political and economic stronghold of the fossil fuel industry’ (Grady-Benson and Sarathy 2016).The risks attached to the stranding of fossil fuel assets have increased with the recent and sustained plunge in oil prices because of the global health pandemic (COVID-19) and the concomitant economic downturn, forcing demand to plummet to unprecedentedly low levels. (Oil prices have recently increased.) Many economies in transition and countries dependent on fossil fuels are going through turbulent times where asset and transition management will be critical (UNEP/SEI 2020). However, COVID-19 provides a foretaste of what a low-carbon transition could look like, especially if assets become stranded in an effort to respond to the call for action in ‘building back better’
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11004: grown into a  global movement (Gunningham 2019). As Mormann (2020) notes, as of November 2020 ‘more than 1,200 institutional investors managing over USD14 trillion of assets around the world have committed to divest some or all of their fossil fuel holdings’. Studies suggest that the direct impacts of the divestment movement have so far been small, given a  failure to differentiate between different types of fossil fuel companies, a lack of engagement with retail investors, and a lack of guidance for investors on clean energy re-investment (Osofsky et al. 2019; Mormann 2020). The movement has had a more significant impact on public discourse by raising the profile of climate change as a financial risk for investors (Bergman 2018). Blondeel et al. (2019) also find that broader appeal of the divestment norm was achieved when moral arguments were linked to financial ones, through the advocacy of economic actors, such as the Bank of England’s governor.

Arguments against divestment point to its largely symbolic nature, but Braungardt et al. (2019) elaborate on the broader positive impacts of divestment, which include its ability to spur climate action as a moral imperative and stigmatise and reduce the power of the fossil fuel lobby, and the potential of the approach to mitigate systemic financial risks arising due to climate change and address the legal responsibilities of investors merging in this regard.Challenges remain with regards to overlapping definitions of sustainable and ESG investment opportunities, which also vary depending on social norms and pathways.

Overall, property rights, land availability, social organization and political networks constitute key factors for IPLCs in accessing and benefiting from carbon offsets (Boyd et al., 2007; Corbera & Brown, 2010; Kerr et al., 2006; Osborne, 2011). Current carbon forest standards have shown moderate success in protecting IPLC rights (De La Fuente & Hajjar, 2013; Larson, 2011; McDermott et al., 2012; Roe et al., 2013). Because many carbon compensation schemes intersect with IPLC sociocultural values, active involvement of IPLCs in policy design has been found to be essential for success, particularly in building partnerships and avoiding value conflicts (Davenport et al., 2010; Fox et al., 2017; Lawlor et al., 2010; Lyver et al., 2016; Richardson & Lefroy, 2016; Rose et al., 2016).

At present about 60% of the atmospheric CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by fossil fuel emission each year (9.4 PgC / year in 2008–2017) is sequestered by nature’s carbon sink in land (3.2 PgC /year in 2008–2017) and in the oceans (2.4 PgC / year in 2008–2017) (Le Quéré et al., 2018), providing a vital role in regulating the Earth’s  climate.Spatial and temporal patterns in carbon sinks and sources are very heterogeneous. Forest ecosystems (e.g., tropical and boreal forests) on average are carbon sinks due to CO2 fertilization, climate change, and recovery from historical CHAPTER 2.2 STATUS AND TRENDS – NATURE216land-use changes (Kondo et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2011). Between 2000 and 2007, the global forest carbon sink is estimated to have removed 2.4 billion tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere (Pan et al., 2011).

This, in turn, has further potential benefits; under the conditions of ‘fair’ income reallocation to public services, this can reduce national carbon footprint by up to 30% while allowing the consumption of those at the bottom to increase (Millward-Hopkins and Oswald 2021). The challenge then is to address the upper limits of consumption. When consumption only just supports the satisfaction of basic needs, any decrease causes deficiencies in human-need satisfaction. This is quite unlinke the case of consumption that exceeds the limits of basic needs, in which deprivation causes a  subjective discomfort (Brand-Correa et  al. 2020).

This carbon storage potential is mostly situated in agricultural land (around 80 Gt C), requiring the development of production systems that combine high yields with close-to-natural soil organic carbon levels .

Additionally, the redistribution of carbon shares from global elites to the global poor is suggested as a welfare-efficient approach (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11439). Furthermore, preventing land-based carbon emissions and restoring soil organic carbon levels can significantly contribute to achieving global carbon budgets (ipbes_assessment_report_ldra_EN, 2020, p.3810). Therefore, based on the available sources, it is clear that reducing one's carbon footprint is essential for addressing climate change and achieving sustainability goals.","Yes, reducing your carbon footprint is beneficial.

Furthermore, redistributing carbon shares from global elites to the global poor has been suggested as welfare efficient (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11439). There are numerous options for carbon consumption reduction measures that can potentially improve societal well-being (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11439).

Within countries and regions, and within sectors, similar patterns hold. The top 10% of the population with the highest per capita footprints account for 27% of the EU carbon footprint, and the top 1% have a carbon footprint of 55 tCO 2-eq per capita, with air transport the most elastic, unequal and carbon-intensive consumption (Ivanova and Wood 2020). Similarly, within sectors, there are large differences in carbon-intensity in the building sector in North America (Goldstein et  al. 2020) and across cities where consumption-based GHG emissions vary widely across the world (ranging from 1.8 to 25.9 tCO 2-eq per capita).Numerous options exist (Broeks et al. 2020; Nyfors et al. 2020) for such carbon consumption reduction measures, while potentially improving societal well-being, for example: (i) inner-city zoning restrictions

This, in turn, has further potential benefits; under the conditions of ‘fair’ income reallocation to public services, this can reduce national carbon footprint by up to 30% while allowing the consumption of those at the bottom to increase (Millward-Hopkins and Oswald 2021). The challenge then is to address the upper limits of consumption. When consumption only just supports the satisfaction of basic needs, any decrease causes deficiencies in human-need satisfaction. This is quite unlinke the case of consumption that exceeds the limits of basic needs, in which deprivation causes a  subjective discomfort (Brand-Correa et  al. 2020). Therefore, to collectively remain within environmental limits, the establishment of minimum and maximum standards of consumption, or sustainable consumption corridors, (Wiedmann et al. 2020) has been suggested, depending on the context.

These programs enable the adoption of new production processes using low- and zero-GHG electricity, hydrogen, fuels, and carbon management, which can significantly contribute to reducing emissions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.190; IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers, 2022, p.154).

It is important to note that these options and new production technologies are generally not considered in recent global scenarios (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.190; IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers, 2022, p.154).","""Zero emissions"" programs are crucial for achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industries, as they involve the adoption of new production processes using low- and zero-GHG electricity, hydrogen, fuels, and carbon management (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.190). They also involve transformational changes in production processes and materials efficiency, which can contribute to reduced emissions (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.190). Furthermore, scenario analyses show that significant cuts in global GHG emissions and even close to net zero emissions from GHG intensive industry can be achieved by 2050 by deploying multiple available and emerging options, which are part of ""zero emissions"" programs (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.8300)."

On top of reducing communities’ exposure to climate risk, adaptation actions can have benefits for reducing urban poverty and enhancing economic performance in ways that reduce inequality and advance sustainability goals. Adaptation actions, however, can also have unintended consequences. That is why care needs to be taken to ensure climate adaptation planning and development of new infrastructure does not exacerbate inequality or negatively impact other sustainable development priorities. Climate adaptation planning is most effective when it is sensitive to the diverse ways that low-income and minority communities are more likely to experience climate risk, including women, children, migrants, refugees, internally displaced peoples and racial/ethnic minority groups, among others.

Climate change adaptation capacity is shaped by historical path dependencies, local context and international linkages, while action is shaped by science, research partnerships and citizen participation (Hernández-Delgado, 2015; Sheller and León, 2016).

Adaptation policies can also hinder some development processes: for example, the promotion of migration as an adaptation strategy can lead to communities being deprived of their workforce and resenting the departure of some of their members (Gemenne and Blocher, 2017), even though this may offer new livelihood opportunities. However, the migration consequences in the context of climate change are often more nuanced and different trade-offs and benefits occur (see Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020). For example, remittances support family members but, at the same time, can also create imbalances in local markets (Melde et  al., 2017). Evidence exists that some climate responses, such as small-scale agricultural livelihood adaptation strategies, have improved the ability of people to sustain their livelihood and to reduce poverty (Osbahr et al., 2010).

The transition has led to social unrest in some cases, especially where there is a culture of entitlement to low-cost energy because it is an indigenous resource. Such reforms have been more effective when governments have been able to clearly show how savings are applied to social and health programs that benefit human well-being. Nevertheless, policymakers should not underestimate the complexity of issues involved in the removal of subsidies that will increase the cost of carbon and hasten the transition to cleaner fuels (Scobie, 2017; Scobie et al., 2018; Chen et al.,

Restoring forest in degraded areas supports biodiversity and can provide benefits to people, ranging from timber to food and recreation.There are some areas where replacing lost trees is useful. These include forest that has been recently cut down and where reforestation is usually practical. However, it is very important to correctly identify areas of forest that are degraded or have definitely been deforested. Reforesting places, especially where existing native forest patches occur, brings benefits both in sucking up carbon from the atmosphere and helping us to adapt to climate change.

Ironically, agriculture is also one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG), accounting for 24% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally (IPCC, 2014). This is a result of multiple factors including loss of carbon following the destruction of native habitat (Fearnside, 2000), massive methane (CH4) emission from rice paddies – the second most widely planted stable crop –(van Groening et al., 2013) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the application of fertilizers (Gerber et al., 2016). In addition, significant emissions of CO2 are emitted from the fossil fuel inputs needed to make agrochemicals and operate machinery (Verma, 2015).

The main perceived advantage of fossil energy is the relatively low costs, and emphasising these costs might increase acceptability somewhat (Pohjolainen et al. 2018; Boyd et al. 2019; Hazboun and Boudet 2020). Acceptability of fossil fuels is, on average, similar to acceptability of nuclear energy, although evaluations are less polarised. People evaluate natural gas as somewhat more acceptable than other fossil fuels, although they generally oppose hydraulic fracturing (Clarke et al. 2016). Yet, natural gas is evaluated as less acceptable than renewable energy sources, although evaluations of natural gas and biogas are similar (Liebe and Dobers 2019; Plum et  al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil energy tends to be higher in countries and regions that strongly rely on them for their energy production (Pohjolainen et  al. 2018;

Fossil fuel use may persist, for example, if and where the costs of such fuels and the compensating carbon management (e.g.,  CDR, CCS) are less than non-fossil energy. For most applications, however, it is likely that electrification (McCollum et al. 2014; Madeddu et al. 2020; Zhang and Fujimori 2020) or use of non-fossil alternative fuels (Zeman and Keith 2008; Graves et al. 2011; Hänggi et al. 2019; Ueckerdt et al. 2021) will prove to be the cheapest options. Most residual demand for fossil fuels is likely to predominantly be petroleum and natural gas given their high energy density (Davis et al. 2018), while demand for coal in net-zero energy systems is likely to be very low (Luderer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020, Section 6.7.4) (high confidence).There is considerable flexibility regarding the overall quantity of

For instance, solar energy has a range of 2.0-7.0 USD kWh-1, while nuclear energy has a cost of 0.88 ± 50% USD kWh-1. Furthermore, bioelectricity with carbon capture and storage (CCS) has a cost of 0.30 ± 50% USD kWh-1. These variations in LCOE highlight the substantial cost differences among different electricity plants (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.8982).","The biggest cost differences among electricity plants can be seen in the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values for different energy sources.

Coal use has been decreasing in the OECD regions, particularly in the USA and the European Union (EU), while remaining mostly flat in China after a period of growth, and it is continuing to increase in other major developing Asian economies (IEA 2020d). Trends in the electricity sector, where most coal is being consumed, are similar. Growth in coal-fired electricity generation capacity in the Asia Pacific region has offset retirements in North America and Europe (Jakob et al. 2020; Global Energy Monitor et al., 2021).Reductions in coal consumption have been driven in large part by non-climate factors, most notably environmental regulations to address air pollution, rapidly declining costs of renewables, and lower natural gas prices, especially inexpensive unconventional gas in the USA.

Declining coal use in both the USA and Canada has decreased GHG emissions, local air pollutants, and cooling water use (Harris et al. 2015; Kondash et al. 2019). However, there have been concerns about social and economic consequences, particularly at the local level. For instance, the USA has lost about 50,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2021 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021), with significant regional and economic inequities (Bodenhamer 2016; Abraham 2017; Greenberg 2018). Comprehensive social programmes, such as retirement compensation, training for reemployment, and business support for economic diversification, have been suggested as means to support a just transition (Homagain et al. 2015; Patrizio et al. 2018; Grubert 2020).

IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.4483: evidence). The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have gone down by utilising hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling for resources in unconventional reservoirs (Wachtmeister and Höök 2020). Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et  al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%. Natural gas liquids could potentially be a lower-carbon alternative to liquid fuels and hydrocarbons. On the

On the other hand, methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain and tailpipe CO 2 emissions remain a  significant concern (Trivedi et  al. 2020). As a result, natural gas as a transition transportation fuel may be limited due to better alternative options being available and due to regulatory pressure to decarbonise the transport sector rapidly.

The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have gone down by utilising hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling for resources in unconventional reservoirs (Wachtmeister and Höök 2020). Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et  al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%. Natural gas liquids could potentially be a lower-carbon alternative to liquid fuels and hydrocarbons. On the

","Based on the provided sources, it can be inferred that the economic viability of oil is uncertain. While some scenarios suggest a decline in oil use and the availability of alternative options such as biofuels and electric vehicles (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.4815), there are also indications that oil may continue to be used through 2050 and remain a significant source of transport fuels (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.4815). Additionally, disruptions in the oil industry due to diversification efforts and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have implications for the just transition away from fossil fuels (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.12938). Therefore, the economic viability of oil is subject to various factors and uncertainties, and a definitive answer cannot be provided based solely on the given sources.","Oil continues to be a significant source of transport fuels in most scenarios limiting global warming to 2°C, and its use may drop to about half of current levels as a transport fuel by 2050 if warming is limited to 2°C due to the availability of other options and rapid deployment of electric vehicles (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.4815). The costs of extracting oil and gas globally have decreased due to the utilization of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling for resources in unconventional reservoirs, which has significantly reduced global prices (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.4483). However, disruptions linked to redundant contracts and postponed or cancelled explorations are occurring as many oil companies are diversifying their production and cutting back on planned hydrocarbon investments (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.12938)."

These developments include improvements in hydrogen production technologies in terms of efficiency and capital costs (e.g., steam methane reforming) (Alrashed and Zahid 2021; Boretti and Banik 2021) and the emergence of alternative production technologies such as electrolysers (Dawood et al. 2020). These technological changes, along with decreasing costs of renewable power, are increasing the viability of hydrogen. Other improvements in hydrogen-based technologies are also emerging quickly. Gas turbines now run on blended fuels containing 5–95% hydrogen by volume (GE 2020) and could operate entirely on hydrogen by 2030 (Pflug et al. 2019). Fuel cell costs have decreased by 80–95% since the early 2000s, while power density and durability have improved (Jouin et al. 2016;

Batteries can provide almost all electricity services, except for seasonal storage. LIBs, in particular, can store energy and power in small volumes and with low weight, making them the default choice for EVs (Placke et al. 2017). EV batteries are expected to form a distributed storage resource as this market grows, both impacting and supporting the grid (Staffell and Rustomji 2016).Drawbacks of batteries include relatively short lifespans and the use of hazardous or costly materials in some variants.

In particular, many African countries require substantial energy infrastructure to support their economic development. The combination of smart technologies with solar and other renewable generation provides a huge opportunity (Anderson et al., 2017; Kolokotsa, 2017).

A review of studies of power densities (electricity generation per unit land area) confirmed the relatively larger land occupation associated with biopower, although hydropower overlaps with biopower (van Zalk and Behrens 2018). This study also quantifies the low land occupation of nuclear energy, similar to fossil energy sources.The land occupation of PV depends on the share of ground-mounted versus buildings-integrated PV, the latter assumed to reach 75% share by 2050 (Luderer et al. 2019). van de Ven et al.

Large installations can also adversely impact biodiversity (Hernandez et  al. 2014), especially where the above-ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a  variety of means have emerged to mitigate land use issues. Substitution among renewables can reduce land conversion (Tröndle 2020).

","The sources provide mixed information on whether electric cars are environmentally friendly when considering production emissions. While some sources highlight the potential for lower greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality through the use of electric vehicles (ipbes_assessment_report_ap_EN, 2021, p.1921; IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.8262), others mention concerns about the environmental impacts of renewable energy development and biofuel production (ipbes_assessment_report_ap_EN, 2021, p.1921). Additionally, the sources mention the need for improvements in battery capacity and charging speed for heavy-duty applications (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.8262). However, none of the sources directly address the question of whether electric cars are still environmentally friendly when considering production emissions. Therefore, based on the provided sources, no definitive answer can be given to the question.","Electric vehicles (EVs) have fewer engine components and lower maintenance requirements than conventional vehicles, but there are potential concerns surrounding battery size/weight, charging time, and battery life (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.8262). The lifecycle costs for electric vehicles are anticipated to be lower than for conventional vehicles by 2030, with high confidence for light-duty vehicles and lower confidence for heavy-duty applications (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2021, p.8271). However, the environmental impact of electric vehicles can vary depending on the upstream electricity source, and potential biodiversity issues related to electricity generation should be considered (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.8250)."

","Baseload power refers to a constant and reliable supply of electricity that is required to meet the minimum level of demand on the grid (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.4552). It typically comes from power plants that operate continuously, such as nuclear power plants or certain types of fossil fuel power plants (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.14730). Intermittent power, on the other hand, refers to electricity generation from renewable sources that are not available consistently, such as wind or solar power (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.14730). These sources of power depend on external factors like weather conditions and are not continuously available. Dispatchable power refers to electricity generation that can be controlled and adjusted to meet the fluctuating demand on the grid (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.4551).

Whereas GWP and GTP describe the marginal effect of each emission relative to the absence of that emission, GWP* describes the equivalent CO 2 emissions that would give the same temperature change as an emissions trajectory of the gas considered, starting at a (user-determined) reference point. The warming based on those cumulative CO 2-equivalent emission at any point in time is relative to the warming caused by emissions of that gas before the reference point. Because of their different focus, GWP* and GWP100 can equate radically different CO 2 emissions to the same CH 4
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.1441: (2021a). There are some differences in actual warming compared to the GWP100 weighted emissions of each gas (Figure 2.4), in particular a greater contribution from CH 4 emissions to historical warming. This is consistent with warming from CH 4 being short-lived and hence having a  more pronounced effect in the near-term during a  period of rising emissions. Nonetheless, Figure 2.4 highlights that emissions weighted by GWP100 do not provide a  fundamentally different information about the contribution of individual gases than modelled actual warming over the historical period, when emissions of most GHGs have been rising continuously, with CO 2 being the dominant and CH 4 being the second most important contributor to GHG-induced warming. Other metrics such as GWP* (or GWP star) (Cain et  al. 2019) offer an even closer resemblance between cumulative CO 2-eq emissions and temperature change. Such a  metric may be more

Electricity energy demandBuilding electricity demand was slightly above 43 EJ in 2019, which is equivalent to more than 18% of global electricity demand. Over the period 1990–2019, electricity demand increased by 161%. The increase of global electricity demand is driven by the combination of rising incomes, income distribution and the S-curve of ownership rates (Wolfram et al. 2012; Gertler et al. 2016).

Singapore has mandatory building energy labels, as do many cities in the US, while India and Brazil have mandatory labels for public buildings.Mandatory energy performance disclosure and benchmarking of building energy consumption is a  powerful policy instrument in particular for non-residential buildings (Trencher et  al. 2016) and could be more accurate than energy audits.

At a basic level, questions of governmental capacity – the numbers and training of personnel – can shape the choices available for climate institutions and their ability to be strategic (Richerzhagen and Scholz 2008; Harrison and Kostka 2014; Kim 2016). Box 13.5 describes South Africa’s approach to building monitoring and evaluation capacity.The perceived need for attention to institutional capacity is highlighted by the fact that the NDCs of 113 developing countries out of 169 countries studied list capacity building as a condition of NDC implementation (Pauw et al. 2020). While international support for capacity is widely articulated as essential for many countries

Institutions are durable and are sources of authority (formal or informal) structuring repeated interactions of individuals, companies, civil society groups, governments, and other entities. Thus, institutional capacity also represents a  broader ‘enabling environment’ which forms the basis upon which individuals and organisations interact. In general terms, capacity is ‘the ability to perform functions, solve problems and set and achieve objectives’ (Fukuda-Parr et al. 2002). Institutional capacity is an important element for regional sustainable development (Farajirad et  al. 2015).

While there is no universally agreed definition of capacity building and the UNFCCC does not define the term (Khan et al. 2020), elements of capacity building can be discerned from the Convention’s provisions on education and training programmes (UNFCCC 1992, Art. 6), as well as the reference in Article 9(2)(d) to the SBSTA providing support for ‘endogenous capacity-building in developing countries’.

Its operation and maintenance costs are typically 2–2.5% of the investment costs per kW yr –1 for a lifetime of 40–80 years (Killingtveit 2020). Construction costs are site-specific. The total cost for an installed large hydropower project

Increased electrification is especially valuable in net-zero energy systems in tandem with decarbonised electricity generation or net-negative emissions electricity generation (Section 6.5.4.2). Flexible electric loads (electric vehicles, smart appliances) can in turn facilitate incorporation of VRE electricity options, increase system flexibility, and reduce needs for grid storage (Section 6.4.3) (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Lund et al. 2018).Several end uses, such as passenger transportation (light-duty electric vehicles, two and three wheelers, buses, rail) as well as building energy uses (lighting, cooling) are likely to be electrified in net-zero energy  systems (high confidence).

The increasing access to electricity facilitates SDG 7 coupled with other SDGs and societal goals, including mitigation of climate change (van Vuuren et  al., 2018) through reducing energy consumption by the use of efficient technology and appliances. Electricity access can be an important enabler of adaptation action for different purposes in different sectors (Mastrucci et al., 2019).Low-carbon development strategies can also be compatible with ecological sustainability, as proponents of bioenergy have claimed.

Declining coal use in both the USA and Canada has decreased GHG emissions, local air pollutants, and cooling water use (Harris et al. 2015; Kondash et al. 2019). However, there have been concerns about social and economic consequences, particularly at the local level. For instance, the USA has lost about 50,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2021 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021), with significant regional and economic inequities (Bodenhamer 2016; Abraham 2017; Greenberg 2018). Comprehensive social programmes, such as retirement compensation, training for reemployment, and business support for economic diversification, have been suggested as means to support a just transition (Homagain et al. 2015; Patrizio et al. 2018; Grubert 2020).

In most developing countries with large coal reserves, coal use has been increasing to support energy security and because it is perceived to have lower costs than alternatives (Steckel et  al. 2015; Kalkuhl et al.2019). However, coal faces increasing business risks from the decreasing costs of alternative, low-emissions energy sources and increasing focus on air pollution and other environmental impacts from coal mining and use (Garg et al. 2017; Sovacool et al. 2021).

Growth in coal-fired electricity generation capacity in the Asia Pacific region has offset retirements in North America and Europe (Jakob et al. 2020; Global Energy Monitor et al., 2021).Reductions in coal consumption have been driven in large part by non-climate factors, most notably environmental regulations to address air pollution, rapidly declining costs of renewables, and lower natural gas prices, especially inexpensive unconventional gas in the USA.

","The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a widely used indicator for assessing the relative attractiveness and cost trends of renewable energy technologies (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11663). It is calculated by considering project-level costs, including installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers, 2022, p.55). However, the LCOE concept does not account for societal costs resulting from de-risking instruments and other public interventions/support, nor does it include the costs of grid integration, climate impacts, and other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall costs of technologies (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2022, p.1627). Therefore, caution should be applied when using LCOE as the sole indicator of the success of enabling environments (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11663).","The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is a widely used indicator for the relative attractiveness of renewable energy and the development of price levels. It is applied by a wide range of public and private stakeholders when tracking progress with regard to cost degression. The LCOE calculation methodologies vary but in principle consider project-level costs only. It includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of electricity produced. However, it does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts, and it does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.11663; IPCC_AR6_WGIII_SummaryForPolicymakers, 2022, p.55)."

Finally, neither electrification nor hydrogen produce local air pollutants at point of end-use.For almost 140 years we have primarily produced electricity by burning coal, oil, and gas to drive steam turbines connected to electricity generators. When switching to low-carbon energy sources – renewable sources, nuclear power, and fossil or bioenergy with CCS – electricity is expected to become a more pervasive energy carrier. Electricity is a versatile energy carrier, with much higher end-use efficiencies than fuels, and it can be used directly to avoid conversion losses. An increasing reliance on electricity from variable renewable sources, notably wind and solar power, disrupts old concepts and makes many existing guidelines obsolete for power system planning, for example, that specific generation types are needed for baseload,

In the 1.5°C scenario (1.5-S) the total annual investment needs excluding fossils and nuclear decrease from 5.0 trillion USD 2015 until 2030 yr–1 to 3.8 trillion USD 2015 yr–1 for 2030–2050 (IRENA 2021). In IAM scenarios of Category C1, electricity supply investments (including generation, transmission and distribution, and storage) remain flat at 2.2 trillion USD 2015 yr–1 through the coming three decades in absolute terms. Given rising GDP , the complementary methods and sources thus consistently point to a peak in electricity supply investments as a percentage of GDP in mitigation scenarios in the coming decade. This reflects the fact that the coming decade requires low-carbon power generation investments to both cover the demand increase and (partly premature) replacement of fossil generation capacities, both concentrated in emerging and developing countries.

US households with lowest expenditures devote nearly 7% of their total spending to electricity, over three times the budget share for the wealthiest decile (Pizer & Sexton, 2017). In the UK, electricity budget shares decline from over 8% among the poorest households to barely 1% for the wealthiest. Likewise in Mexico, to a lesser degree (Pizer & Sexton, 2017). Flues & Thomas (2015) find electricity taxes to be regressive in 21 OECD countries based on expenditure shares.  Yet, energy and gasoline taxes tend not to be regressive in poorer countries, as vehicle ownership rates as well as commuting patterns matter greatly. Transportation-fuels taxes are thought to be progressive in Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Turkey, as well as in Chile and Hungary, where vehicle ownership differs across incomes by an order of magnitude (Flues & Thomas, 2015; Pizer & Sexton, 2017).

Globally, the range of global PV costs is quite similar to the range of coal and natural gas prices.PV costs (Figure 6.8) have fallen for various reasons: lower silicon costs, automation, lower margins, automation, higher efficiency, and a  variety of incremental improvements (Fu et  al. 2018; Green 2019) (Chapter  16). Increasingly, the costs of PV electricity are concentrated in the installation and related ‘soft costs’ (marketing, permitting) associated with the technology rather than in the modules themselves, which now account for only 30% of installed costs of rooftop systems (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2019; IRENA 2021b). Financing costs are a  significant barrier in developing countries (Ondraczek et al. 2015) and growth there depends on access to low-cost finance (Creutzig et al. 2017).CSP costs have also fallen, albeit at about half the rate of PV: –9% yr –1

In IAM scenarios of Category C1, electricity supply investments (including generation, transmission and distribution, and storage) remain flat at 2.2 trillion USD 2015 yr–1 through the coming three decades in absolute terms. Given rising GDP , the complementary methods and sources thus consistently point to a peak in electricity supply investments as a percentage of GDP in mitigation scenarios in the coming decade.

IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2018, p.4806: Stronger near-term mitigation will reduce premature retirements of fossil infrastructure, because more rapid mitigation will decrease new builds of fossil infrastructure that might later be stranded (Johnson et al. 2015; Bertram et al. 2018) (high confidence). For example, if warming is limited to 2°C, strengthening the NDC pledges beyond their 2015 levels could decrease stranded electricity sector assets by more than 50% (Iyer et al. 2015). By contrast, if countries fail to meet their NDCs and continue to build fossil infrastructure, mitigation will need to be accelerated beyond 2030, resulting up to double the amount of stranded electricity generation capacity (Iyer et al. 2015). This corresponds to a total undiscounted cost of about USD2 trillion from electricity infrastructure alone, from the period 2015 to 2050 (IRENA 2017).

These cost drivers fall into four categories: design maturity; project management; regulatory stability and predictability; and multi-unit and series effects (NEA 2020). With lessons learned from first-of-a-kind projects, the cost of electricity for new builds are expected to be in the range of USD42–102 MWh–1 depending on the region (IEA 2020j).Lifetime extensions are significantly cheaper than new builds and cost competitive with other low-carbon technologies. The overnight cost of lifetime extensions is estimated in the range of USD390–630 kWe–1 for Europe and North America, and the LCOE in the range of USD30–36 MWh–1 for extensions of 10–20 years (IEA 2020j).Cost-cutting opportunities, such as design standardisation and innovations in construction approaches, are expected to make SMRs competitive against large reactors by 2040 (Rubio and Tricot 2016)

Pumped storage hydropower stores energy by pumping water to higher reservoirs during low-demand periods (Killingtveit 2020). The storage in hydropower systems provides flexibility to compensate for rapid variations in electricity loads and supplies. The regulating characteristics of the storage play an important role in assuring continuity of energy supply from renewable sources (Yang et al. 2018b).Hydropower is one of the lowest-cost electricity technologies (Mukheibir 2013; IRENA 2021b). Its operation and maintenance costs are typically 2–2.5% of the investment costs per kW yr –1 for a lifetime of 40–80 years (Killingtveit 2020). Construction costs are site-specific.

However, solar energy systems installed as utility-scale solar energy enterprises, may have impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services during construction, operation or decommissioning (Hernandez et al., 2014). Locally, concentrating solar power impact biodiversity losses where there is vegetation clearance and gradation of soils; and by fragmenting landscapes, they create barriers to movement of species and their genes leading to regional impacts (Hernandez et al., 2014).

In particular, many African countries require substantial energy infrastructure to support their economic development. The combination of smart technologies with solar and other renewable generation provides a huge opportunity (Anderson et al., 2017; Kolokotsa, 2017). However, care must be taken in rapidly developing cities, as failure to ensure energy access during urbanisation can reduce resilience (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2018).6.3.5.5 TransportA wide range of adaptation options are available for transport infrastructure and most provide a good benefit cost ratio (Doll, Klug and Enei, 2014; Forzieri et  al., 2018).

Solar arrays can reduce the albedo, particularly in desert landscapes, which can lead to local temperature increases and regional impacts on wind patterns (Millstein and Menon 2011).

When switching to low-carbon energy sources – renewable sources, nuclear power, and fossil or bioenergy with CCS – electricity is expected to become a more pervasive energy carrier. Electricity is a versatile energy carrier, with much higher end-use efficiencies than fuels, and it can be used directly to avoid conversion losses. An increasing reliance on electricity from variable renewable sources, notably wind and solar power, disrupts old concepts and makes many existing guidelines obsolete for power system planning, for example, that specific generation types are needed for baseload,

The marginal cost of deploying electricity sector mitigation options increases as electricity emissions approach zero; in addition, the most cost-effective mix of system resources changes as emissions approach zero and, therefore, so do the implications of electricity sector mitigation for sustainability and other societal goals (Mileva et  al. 2016; Bistline et  al. 2018; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Jayadev et al. 2020; Cole et al. 2021).

Current actors are typically resistant to disruptions, even if such disruptions may broadly benefit society (Kungl 2015; Schmid et al. 2017; Mori 2018).For example, one energy system characterised by differentiated institutional interactions is the USA, where delivery of liquid fuels is lightly regulated, while electricity delivery is closely regulated (Dworkin et  al. 2013). Reforming this two-pronged system for decarbonisation would require four types of institutional change: (i) changes to the control systems that coordinate generation and transmission through a  pyramidal architecture for the operational control, dispatch, and delivery of electricity with a primary emphasis on reliability; (ii) changes to the financing of central-station power plants through long-term bonds, as valued by Wall Street ratings [END OF SOURCES]

Smart grids are being increasingly deployed within municipalities to provide more efficient management of supply and demand and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, however, there is limited understanding of their performance and reliability during floods and other extreme weather events (Vasenev, Montoya and Ceccarelli, 2016; Feldpausch-Parker et al., 2018).Adaptation and preparedness at the household level can minimise impacts during power outages, but neighbourhood-level assistance may be more appropriate to ensure support for vulnerable households and coordination of action and information (Ghanem, Mander and Gough, 2016). More generally, it is important for responder organisations to integrate energy needs in disaster preparedness and response plans. Whilst over the longer term, reducing household and industrial demand for energy supply will reduce the need for capital investments and upgrades (Fu et al., 2017).

Less reliance on thermal electricity generation technologies will reduce the risks of curtailment or efficiency losses from droughts and heat waves (Lohrmann et  al. 2019). More generally, increased electricity system integration and flexibility (Section 6.4.3) and weatherisation of generators increases electricity system resilience (Busby et al. 2021; Heffron et al. 2021). Likewise, local district micro-grids with appropriate enabling technologies (e.g., distributed generation, energy storage, greater demand-side participation, electric vehicles) may ensure access to electricity during major long-duration power outage events and radically enhance the resilience of supply of essential demand (Stout et al. 2019).670Chapter 6 Energy Systems66.5.4 Impacts on Electricity System VulnerabilityWhile long-term trends are important for electricity system planning,

This is due to a number of different factors, such as unreliable existing infrastructure, fractured fiscal authority, lack of electricity access in urban areas, upfront cost, financial barriers, inefficient pricing of electricity, and low consumer education and engagement (Venkatachary et al. 2018; Acakpovi et al. 2019; Cirolia 2020).Pathways and trade-offs of electrification in urban systemsUrbanisation and population density are one of the key drivers for  enabling access to electricity across the world, with benefits

Although most private PV owners would make their storage system available as balancing load for the grid operator, the acquisition of new batteries by a majority of consumers requires incentives (Gährs et al. 2015).

The main perceived advantage of fossil energy is the relatively low costs, and emphasising these costs might increase acceptability somewhat (Pohjolainen et al. 2018; Boyd et al. 2019; Hazboun and Boudet 2020). Acceptability of fossil fuels is, on average, similar to acceptability of nuclear energy, although evaluations are less polarised. People evaluate natural gas as somewhat more acceptable than other fossil fuels, although they generally oppose hydraulic fracturing (Clarke et al. 2016). Yet, natural gas is evaluated as less acceptable than renewable energy sources, although evaluations of natural gas and biogas are similar (Liebe and Dobers 2019; Plum et  al. 2019).

Genomic technologies used to study genes and their functions generate an unprecedented amount of information, and require bioinformatics to manage the collection, classification, storage and analysis of vast and complex biological data (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2017).

DNA sequence information is used to identify markers of desirable traits that can be enriched in breeding programmes, as well as to quantify the genetic variability in species (Gepts, 2014; Brozynska et al., 2016; Voss-Fels and Snowdon, 2016). However, breeding for smallholder farmers and the stresses caused by climate change are unlikely to be addressed by the private sector and will require more public investment and adjusting to the local social-ecological system (Glover, 2014; Heinemann et  al., 2014; Acevedo [END OF SOURCES]

Warmer climates and higher frequency and intensity of heat waves can lead to higher loads (Dirks et al. 2015; Auffhammer et al. 2017), increasing the risk of grid failure and supply interruptions.Although heating demand in cold climate regions can be expected to decrease with climate change and, to a  certain extent, outweigh the increase in cooling demand, the effects on total primary energy requirements are uncertain (Li et  al. 2012; Wan et  al. 2012).

The relationship between a carbon tax and the resulting emission reductions is complex and is influenced by changes in fossil fuel prices, changes in fossil fuel taxes, and other mitigation policies (Aydin and Esen 2018). But the effectiveness of a  carbon tax generally is higher in countries where it constitutes a large part of the fossil fuel price (Andersson 2019). Few of the world’s carbon prices are at a level consistent with various estimates of the carbon price needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals. In modelling of mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>50%)(Section  3.6.1) marginal abatement costs of carbon in 2030 are about 60 to 120 USD2015 per tCO 2, and about 170 to 290  USD2015 per tCO 2 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Section  3.6).

Governance that builds on diverse expertise and considers a variety of actions is best equipped to manage remaining risks.Climate change is projected to inﬂuence extreme events and to potentially cause abrupt changes in the ocean
IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2022, p.8625: and inequality, undermine progress in meetings Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and place strain on civil institutions—all of which are factors that contribute to the emergence or worsening of civil unrest and conflict. Climate change impacts on crop productivity and water availability can function as a ‘risk multiplier’ for conflict in areas that are already politically and/or socially fragile and, depending on circumstances, could increase the length or the nature of an existing conflict. Institutional initiatives within or between states to protect the environment and manage natural resources can serve simultaneously as mechanisms for engaging rival groups and adversaries to cooperate in policymaking and peacebuilding.71129Health, Wellbeing and the Changing Structure of Communities  Chapter 7Frequently Asked QuestionsFAQ 7.5 | What are some specific examples of actions taken in other sectors that reduce climate change risks in the health sector?

","The most effective ways of fighting climate change include reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the occurrence of extreme events and abrupt changes (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2020, p.313). Additionally, it is crucial to establish networks of protected areas to reduce climatic and non-climatic impacts and increase resilience to climate change (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.14496). Furthermore, reducing non-climatic stressors such as nutrient loads, resource extraction, habitat fragmentation, and pesticides on land is considered important for adaptation and increasing resilience to climate change impacts (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.14496). It is also essential to address underlying gender inequalities exacerbated by climate impacts and ensure sustainable development (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.9145). Finally, transformative climate action should be guided by holistic, egalitarian worldviews that promote environmental care and accelerate climate action (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.20863).","The most effective ways of fighting climate change include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which will decrease the occurrence of extreme events and the likelihood of abrupt changes in natural systems (08_SROCC_Ch06_FINAL, 2020, p.313). Another strategy is to reduce climate risk through immediate and long-term adaptation efforts by governments, businesses, civil society, and individuals at a scale and speed significantly faster than current trends (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.1168). Reducing non-climatic stressors such as nutrient loads, resource extraction, habitat fragmentation, or pesticides on land can increase resilience to climate-change impacts (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.14496). The establishment of networks of protected areas is a major governance tool to reduce climatic and non-climatic impacts (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.14496). Lastly, facilitating climate actions that embrace climate resilience, equity, justice, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development can also be effective (IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport, 2018, p.20863)."

The transition has led to social unrest in some cases, especially where there is a culture of entitlement to low-cost energy because it is an indigenous resource. Such reforms have been more effective when governments have been able to clearly show how savings are applied to social and health programs that benefit human well-being.

Increasing effectiveness through economic instruments is a challenge that needs to be complemented by non-economic approaches. Prices attached to resource use or abstraction (e.g., water, energy) need to consider effects on poorer parts of the population. Increasing the price of energy and water has implications for the affordability of these resources among poorer households. The key challenge is to improve both efficiency and economy of use in a way that is pro-poor. This can happen through economic instruments, such as differential tariffs for industrial and domestic customers as in Moldova (OECD, 2012a) or progressive taxes and compensation measures for poorer households (OECD, 2013b), but other, non-economic instruments need to contribute here, too.

Atmospheric measurements indicate that methane emissions from fossil fuel production are larger than shown in emissions inventories (Schwietzke et al. 2016). Only a small fraction of global CH 4 emissions is regulated. Mitigation policies focus on landfills, coal mines, and oil and gas operations. Regulations and incentives to capture and utilise methane from coal seams came into effect in China in 2010 (Tan 2018; Tao et al. 2019).

While methane emissions have grown less rapidly than CO 2 and F-gases since 1990 (Chapter 2), the literature urges action to bring methane back to a pathway more in line with the Paris goals (Nisbet et al. 2020). Measures to reduce methane emissions from anthropogenic sources are considered intractable – where they sustain livelihoods  – but also becoming more feasible, as studies report the options for mitigation in agriculture without undermining food security (Wollenberg et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Nisbet et al. 2020). The choice of emission metrics has implications for SLCF (Cain et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2). Ambitious reductions of methane are complementary to, rather than substitutes for, reductions in CO 2 (Nisbet et al. 2020).

For this reason, methane reductions from coal mining can be accomplished through coal mine methane recovery (where methane and coal are recovered simultaneously) and from the ventilation air, which can cumulatively reduce methane emissions by 50–75% (Zhou et al. 2016; Singh and Hajra 2018). Governments incentivise such operations through a number of emissions trading and offset programmes (Haya et al. 2020). Methane emissions in the oil and gas sector can be reduced by leak detection and repair, relevant across varying time scales (hours to decades) and regional scopes (component/facility level to continental) (Fox et al. 2019).

Around 50% of the methane emitted from oil and gas infrastructure can be mitigated at net-negative costs; that is, the market price of the recovered methane is higher than the mitigation costs (IEA 2021e). As CO 2 emissions are reduced and fossil fuel consumption decreases, methane emissions associated with these supply chains are anticipated to decline (Section 6.7). That said, substantial ‘legacy’ methane emissions – methane leaks after abandonment – will remain, even if a complete fossil fuel phase-out takes place. These legacy emissions are estimated to be less than 1–4% of overall methane emissions across all fossil fuel sources (Kholod et al. 2020; Williams et al. 2021b). Even without a complete phase-out, 50–80% of methane emissions from coal, oil and gas could be avoided with currently available technologies at less than USD50 tCO 2-eq–1 [END OF SOURCES]

Multiple such small agreements, each acceptable within like groups, could constitute complementary elements in global political frameworks for environmental governance (Falkner et al., 2010; Hale & Roger, 2014). Technical innovations matter greatly. Barrett et al. (2006) shows that technologies with increasing returns can succeed where coordination by countries is possible: if the treaty enters into force only after a specific number of countries has signed on, then no country loses and each country could gain from signing on after that  number.Focusing on biodiversity in particular, CITES is an example of a form of global governance that is evolving in implementation via interaction with its member states, in light of species scarcity. CITES is an agreement between governments to ensure that international trade in specimens

Trade rules may impede mitigation action by limiting countries’ discretion in adopting trade-related climate policies, but they also have the potential to stimulate the international adoption and diffusion of mitigation technologies and policies (Droege et al. 2017).The mitigation impacts of trade agreements are difficult to ascertain, and the limited evidence is mixed. Examining the effects of three free trade agreements (FTAs) – Mercosur, the North American Free
IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.1041: climate negotiations, have been identified (Stoddard et al. 2021). International cooperation can also seem to be a barrier to ambitious action when negotiation is trapped in ‘relative-gains’ calculus, in which countries seek to game the regime or gain leverage over one another (Purdon 2017), or where states lower ambition to the ‘least common dominator’ to accommodate participation of the least ambitious states (Falkner 2016). Geden (2016) and Dubash (2020) offer more nuanced assessments.International collaboration works best if an agreement can be made self-reinforcing with incentives for mutual gains and joint action (Barrett 2016; Keohane and Victor 2016), but the structure of the climate challenge makes this hard to achieve. The evidence from the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances and from the Kyoto Protocol on GHGs, is that legally binding targets have been effective in that participating Parties complied with them (Shishlov et al. 2016; [END OF SOURCES]

","Concerned governments should negotiate international treaties because existing international obligations provide a normative framework and a level playing field for basin-level implementation at national and transboundary levels (202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2018, p.6353). Basin-level treaties can offer effective mechanisms for managing transboundary basins and preventing the escalation or emergence of disputes (Brochmann & Hensel 2009; Tir & Stinnett 2012; Dinar et al., 2015). Additionally, international cooperation and agreements play a crucial role in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, as they can stimulate the adoption and diffusion of mitigation technologies and policies (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.10784; 202206_IPBES GLOBAL REPORT_FULL_DIGITAL_MARCH 2022, 2020, p.901). While there may be challenges and complexities in negotiating and implementing treaties, evidence from the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol suggests that legally binding targets have been effective in achieving compliance (IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport, 2019, p.1041).","Yes, concerned governments should negotiate international treaties.
