Online263increased, 2020, p.8: Radioimmunoassays (RIAs) use antibodies to detect and quantitate the amount of antigen (analyte) in a sample. These assays are typically very sensitive and specific. It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites. When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.

It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M).

When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.

It is possible to detect as low as a few picograms of analyte in the experimental tube when using antibodies of high affinity (Kd = 10 -8 - 10 -11 M). The basic principle of radioimmunoassay is competitive binding, where a radioactive antigen (""tracer"") competes with a non-radioactive antigen for a fixed number of antibody or receptor binding sites. When unlabeled antigen from standards or samples and a fixed amount of tracer (labeled antigen) are allowed to react with a constant and limiting amount of antibody, decreasing amounts of tracer are bound to the antibody as the amount of unlabeled antigen is increased.
