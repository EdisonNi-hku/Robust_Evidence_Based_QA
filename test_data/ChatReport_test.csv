They evaluate similar scenarios to better prepare for these risks (Source258, 2021, p.26). PNC actively manages their own internal operations to make them more sustainable and enhance operational efficiency (Source221, 2021, p.23). They have published their first Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report, which outlines their climate risk management strategy (Source9, 2021, p.4). PNC also incorporates climate change and other environmental risks into their mortgage origination and underwriting processes (Source376, 2021, p.37). They have an Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) framework to recognize and address climate, human rights, and other environmental and social risks (Source251, 2021, p.25).

In addition, they use an Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) framework to recognize how climate and other environmental and social risks could drive financial, legal, and/or reputational risks to the organisation (Source251, 2021, p.25). The organisation also actively manages ESG risk at both the transaction and the portfolio levels (Source84, 2021, p.12).

","Assurant's strategy demonstrates resilience when considering different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C target or lower scenario. The company conducted a preliminary scenario analysis in 2021, with third-party support, to identify and analyze climate-related risks faced by critical facilities across the globe (Source215, 2022, p.37). This analysis was reviewed with the full company's Board (Source167, 2022, p.32). Assurant integrates climate-related risk identification into its multidisciplinary, company-wide risk identification and management processes (Source234, 2022, p.38). The company also explores climate-related opportunities to enhance resilience (Source216, 2022, p.37). However, there is no specific information available in the sources regarding the resilience of Assurant's strategy when considering climate physical risks.","Assurant has conducted a preliminary scenario analysis to identify and analyze various climate-related risks across its operations, including a ""two-degree"" scenario and a ""business-as-usual"" scenario (Source215, 2022, p.37). This analysis was reviewed with the company's Board and Management Committee, indicating a high level of strategic resilience (Source167, 2022, p.32; Source172, 2022, p.32). The company also integrates climate-related risk identification into its company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes (Source234, 2022, p.38). Assurant's strategy considers both transition and physical risks, including the impact of climate-related hazards on its growth strategy and the risk of stranded assets in carbon-intensive industries (Source174, 2022, p.33; Source180, 2022, p.33). To manage physical risks, Assurant maintains a reinsurance program that reduces its financial exposure to climate change (Source218, 2022, p.37). The company also considers climate risks and opportunities in its business strategy, which it believes drives long-term profitability and resilience (Source204, 2022, p.36)."
